I've been working in an office the last 5 years where I'm sitting down the majority of the day.

Obviously going to listen to Jim‚Äôs advice, but curious why everybody here thinks too:

For reference, I am 6‚Äô2 and 210.

1.) Length: Either 5‚Äô6 or 5‚Äô8
2.) Width: TBD (at least 21‚Äù)
3.) Thickness: thinking 2.75-3‚Äù

4.) Either volan patch or triple stringer 
(prob the patch - I beat up my boards so either could work. I love the triple stringer stiffness on my other boards but not sure how well it would translate to a fish)

5.) Debating marine ply glass-ons or futures (keels either way - it‚Äôs a fish)

I am sure this question has been asked before, and for that I apologize. I‚Äôve been surfing for about 7 months now, and love it. Mostly long boarding in SoCal. I come from a motorsports background and have always been fascinated by chassis design, setup, tuning, etc. 

With that in mind, I‚Äôd love any input on great resources on board design or why shapers make the choices they do. From books, to YouTube, to articles, im open to all!

I‚Äôve gone down the YouTube rabbit hole, and read a decent amount, enough to make my head swirl. The shapes are fascinating - it really makes you appreciate hand shaped boards and decisions.

Meaning I can handle head high ground swell on a 6'0 HPSB thruster, late drops, solid bottom turn, up and down the face 5-6 times on a clean wave. My current goals are: generate speed, faster turns, more verticle turns, better form overall, and of course more work on my duckdive. I know I can do all of these by setting up a camera and posting footage here for review. But I progressed so much with a private coach a year ago, that I want to do it again.

The climax of that trip was he took me to Supertubos when it was 1.5 overhead which I certainly want to repeat. Other spots we went to were 15-20' which I paddled out for, wasn't ready for. I just priced the same place out but thought it'd be good to ask for other options here before committing. Especially because that area can get too big in winter.   


Timeframe is middle december and the budget is $2000. Prices right now for Peniche are: $550 flight from Newark, $50/per night room, $75 each coach sessions, bringing my own board. i dont mind going on the cheap as long as its safe and clean. thank you",surfing

1697236462.0,Matuse wetsuit owners - fit question,"I just took receipt of a Matuse Scipio (3/3) chest zip wetsuit and am have some fit concerns. Communication with Matuse has been slow and I need to make a decision on whether to keep or exchange in time for a trip that departs in 10 days.

I'm in that no man's land between L, LT, and XL and in many cases end up finding a really good fit when sizing down. 

For reference I'm 6'0"" / 200lb and an O'Neill L fits perfectly. Per their size chart I'm on the borderline in height and over in weight. XL has gaps all over (armpits, backs of knees, lower back, etc) and LT is way too long in arms and legs. 

The Matuse is proving to be a challenge which is compounded by the fact that I was only able to order 1 size option. Based on feedback from Matuse I ordered the XL and while it does fit I'm having two  issues:

1. There is some bunching in the armpits and above the elbows.
2. The rear of the collar is pulling away from my neck a bit. I can get it to lay flat if I pull the back of the suit up, but it resets to this position once I bend forward a few times. I suspect that once in the water the back of the suit will reset itself a bit and this will smooth out. 

Here are some images which illustrate: [https://imgur.com/a/JPWbFe7](https://imgur.com/a/JPWbFe7)

On top of that while the suit is definitely form-fitting and generally tight to the skin it's not *TIGHT* (like compressively tight) as I was expecting from a number of comments referencing Matuse and Yamamoto suits in general. In fact it was relatively easy to get on and off which is in stark contrast to my exiting 4/3 and 3/2 suits which are a bit of a struggle to get off the shoulders. 

So the question is whether or not the issues I'm having are enough to be concerned that the suit is going to be a leaky, cold, flushing mess. 

If I size down I'm pretty confident that the bunching in the armpits will resolve, but the collar is making me a bit concerned. The suit would also be compression-tight, which I'm OK with as long as it stretches and molds to fit.

If you have some experience with Matuse suits and how they tend to fit please let me know!

**Tl;dr:** Concerned about some fit issues with a Matuse Scipio (see image link above) and whether or not they will cause real problems in actual use. Keep it and surf it or send it back for an L or LT?

Would you guys recommend mend purchasing something bigger maybe in the 6,3-6,6 range or should I be fine on my current setup?

Enjoy my Seaside 5.5 on bigger days, but it can get crazy fast and lacks the pivot I enjoy with a Twin+trailer (which is what I have in my Maysym). My 5.7 seaside feels like a boat, and don't ride it much anymore. I'd probably be really happy with a custom 5.6 Seaside with a center box, slightly narrower with more thickness to keep the volume, but really hesitant to order that custom. I like the Maysym, but want a fishy tail and a bit shorter. Which brings me here, deciding between the Mick's Tape and a RNF 96.",surfing

1697035986.0,how to get over fear of waves,"so this might be a slightly different post since I am not a surfer but thought you could all help me since this getting swept up by waves is a regular occurrence for any surfer.

I'll try to keep it short: I was in biarritz (atlantic ocean) in july when I went to the beach to go swimming. the waves were horrendously high and it was not recommended to go in but there were many people in the water anyway (+surfers in the distance).

I was pretty scared but thought it was one of those moments where I just had to take the leap and it would be fine. the waves seemed fine one moment and then out of control the next (unpredictable basically) so I stood at the beach for a while before running in.

first wave when I went in was okay, when the second one approached there were two children at the top and all I thought was cool theyre gonna fall onto my face and break my nose.
no way of even attempting to swim under the wave as there were too many people in the water.
so I got the washing maschine treatment, immediately let go of my sunglasses (4 weeks old and worth $90).
second wave didn't hit me as hard, after that I was washed up back on the beach.

I could hardly speak after, swallowed some salt water that also went up my nose, had a ton of sand in my swimsuit/hair/ears, I was basically in shock.

and ever since I keep thinking back and wish this hadnt happened. has anyone ever made a similar experience?
it feels like I'm horribly scared of the ocean now. I've always had a lot of respect for the tides and the power that the water holds but it seems some deep trust in me just broke.
and ive been pushed into the sand before by smaller waves/closer to the beach but this time it was in deep waters where I couldnt even stand/ was pushed down several meters.

I figured since surfers get swept up in waves much bigger than what I was subjected to some of you might be able to offer some advice.

I'm not sure who won, but I gotta say all it did was make me fall in love with Kelly Slater even more. What a fucking guy, somehow many years ago I thought he was a bit of an asshole, but man people are just jealous as hell, he might be one of the people I admire the most, as a person first, as a surfer second.

UNRELATED RANT INCOMING:

The high five with Rob Machado for example, I don't believe for a second he masterminded that move to get priority, and when he told Andy at the final that he was his brother no matter what, then again, I think he's just that lovable guy. And they show that in Andy's documentary, Kelly was a nice guy, that of course was competitive, but he was the guy you could bring home to your parents. Andy was the mean guy that would get depressed if he lost and would talk about crushing Kelly's dreams and whatnot. (I know he was bipolar though, but it doens't change those facts). Kelly admits he told him he was old, and bald and over the hill, that's to me what horrible sportmanship is like. But to say to a guy that you love him as a brother regardless of who wins that's amazing.

Plus of course if you were going to do that, you'd do it at the final. I think Kelly is just so real and honest that some people have a hard time understanding that and wanted to desperately seek hidden intentions and motives.

&#x200B;

By the way I completely hate Andy Iron's girlfriend, sure, she didn't know he had a world title, but she met him and ""fell in love"" after he won it, that's what I consider a coincidence, and the way she talks about Kelly  especially just makes me cringe

&#x200B;

And idk, so it's hard to judge the contest given that I'm definitely biased towards Kelly. But what do you guys think? Should Andy have won that year?

1696968846.0,Tecate Police Shenanigans,"tl;dr --- coming home from a Baja surf trip, surfboards on the roof, we were targeted by Mexican police and prevented from progressing to the US border unless we paid a $200 fee for a ""traffic infraction."" 

After a really nice surf / camp trip, yesterday my friend, son and I were in the border line to head back into the states at Tecate. After about an hour in the line, we got to the point where the single line splits into two. We chose the right lane, but noticed too late that several vehicles ahead of us were trying to get out of the right lane we were in, and merge into the left lane. This was causing the right line to stop. After waiting about 10 minutes at a dead stop, my buddy got out of the car and walked up to the US CBP agent at the gate. He asked the agent if the right gate was open, and the agent said yes, but that the Mexicans had placed a barricade blocking movement in that lane. My buddy looked, and sure enough a barricade had been placed at the font of the line for that US entry gate. The US agent said although the gate was open, he could not do anything about the barricade as it was in Mexican territory.

When my buddy got back to our car, he said we'd need to get into the left lane because the right lane had been barricaded by what seemed like some homeless guy wearing a reflective consruction vest. But as we tried to merge into the left lane (thank you sweet lady for letting us merge), two Mexican motocycle cops rode up, and one of them parked in front of our car. I asked him what's up and he said we'd need to merge into the left lane, but that we would then have to exit that lane back into Tecate and drive to the back of line. He acted as if we had taken cuts (which I know is a big no no at Tecate). But this was not the case. There were dozens of cars in the right lane, all there after having been in the single lane for nearly an hour. The US gate for that lane was open, but that random dude had moved a barricade to block progress. The second cop then blocked all left lane traffic, causing a gap, and motioned us to drive into that lane then exit back into Tecate. I asked him why we couldn't just proceed to the US border in the left lane, and he said if we did it would be an infraction.

I really didn't want to drive back to the end of the line and wait for another hour, so I asked him how much the ""ticket"" for the ""infraction"" would be. He smiled and said, ""200 dollars."" I offered him $40. He laughed and motioned for us to exit the line back into Tecate proper. I didn't want to pay any more that $40 for this kind of bullshit, and not wanting to risk being fucked with again, we decided to exit the Tecate line and drive to Otay, where we crossed without issues in about 30 minutes.

1696903303.0,"Sharks, we're fine","So, I've been scrolling through the abyss that is the oceanic internet and noticed some fellow sharks stressing over the lack of humans to nibble on. Let me break it down for you.

Some of our kin are fretting over the humans' shark attack stats like it's last call at the Golden Coral. Trust me, it's time to embrace the oceanic feast that awaits us. It's like trying to find a krill in a sea of plankton.

Now, check this out ‚Äì there are over 7 billion humans on land, and a good chunk of them can't resist the call of the waves. We're talking over a billion humans entering the waters annually. Yet, we only managed 52 nibbles. We're just scratching the surface.

So, fellow sharks, let go of that shark paranoia. Humans are practically doing synchronized swimming into our jaws. We've got a world of feasting potential out there. And if you can't see it then you need to lay off the algae blooms.

Stay stealthy, stay toothy, and remember... The ocean is our oyster, filled with humans waiting to be our snack! ",surfing

1696869341.0,"Sharks, you're fine","I see a lot of posts about shark paranoia here, which makes sense as there are a lot of new surfers in here who are presumably new to ocen sports in general.

As a former beach lifeguard for 5 years and current Emergency Trauma nurse for 2 years, I feel confident in saying that your fear of sharks is over blown.

A quick Google search on shark attack statistics will show you that in 2022 there were 52 shark attacks worldwide.... Not deaths, just bites, for the entire glode in a year (of those 52 some probably died, but the point still stands. The number is very small.)

There are over 7 billion people on the planet, the majority live near the coast. A large percentage of those enter the coastal waters with some regularity. Even if the reported number is only accounting for more developed nations, that's still a pool of at least 1 billion entering their waters annually as a reasonable estimate. 

52 out of 1 billion is infinitesimal.

We had some great swell these last few days here in the UK, pretty big and powerful. I'm riding my 7'6 mal thruster as usual, and I had a few waves where I attempted a deep bottom turn and just ended up sliding out and getting a good pounding (?) afterwards.

The board is a pretty chunky shape with big round rails. I never really had an issue with sliding out before but the waves are usually a lot weaker, I feel like the extra speed combined with the rail shape may have caused the slide but I'm not totally sure.

My understanding is that a full rail is more forgiving/stable, so maybe it's just bad technique? Would a board with a harder rail help with bottom turns on the cleaner and more powerful waves?

1696858970.0,Novice anecdotal report of trying to surf in Okinawa,"Tldr: hard to luck into waves. Make a plan for the right spot for the season, bring boards or confirm a rental, maybe get a local guide/pro. 

writing this up in case it helps someone else since I struggled to get a sense of the place. So I just got home from a family trip (spouse, two kids ages 8&10) to Japan. We spent 4 days of the trip in Okinawa to relax, and enjoy the beach. I planned to spend one or two of the mornings in the water like I always do when family trips take me to surf destinations (bali, El Salvador, nicaragua, Mexico, Hawaii‚Ä¶): just find a shop, rent a board, ask where to surf and figure it out. 

This did not work. I was only on the main island with no time or plan to get a boat to good waves, and even with the typhoon off taiwan pushing swell, I got pretty skunked.

Difficulties: most of the known and ok for tourists waves are pretty fickle, from what people told me. Wind and swell direction matter a ton.
They‚Äôre also mainly high-tide only (so 2 hrs on either side) breaks because if shallow reef. 
There are two, maybe three places to ‚Äúrent boards‚Äù from what I could tell online, but all were closed Wednesday, so that was out. 

I ended up getting help from Danny of Happy Surfing Okinawa. (Google or IG). He runs a beginners surf camp and can send his partner to take better surfers hunting for decent waves in the van. (I didn‚Äôt do this because I was crunched for time, but everywhere was blown out so that crew ended up at the beginner spot anyway). And he obviously uses foam boards, and doesn‚Äôt rent out anything else. So he was great and I did my best to make a decent morning of 1-2 and super choppy conditions. He was rad, did his best, and runs a good surf school. 

Nonetheless, I wish I had skipped it and spent more time on uruma snorkeling.

Mine was at Dreamland, Bali around 2016. At the time I was pretty inexperienced in anything overhead and it was mostly overhead sets. I paddled out through the channel and sat at the right as that's where most of the crowd was that day but I got intimidated by the size of the sets and the crowd so decided to paddle across the channel to the left which was where I usually surfed and there was hardly anyone out there. Caught a smaller set wave and paddled back out and was feeling pretty good. Then all of a sudden the horizon just started to lift up like it was being pushed up from below by some massive unseen force and it just kept on rising up until it had formed a grotesquely perfect looking turquoise wall of terror.

Usually when you get caught out by a sneaker set you react quickly and take action, but I was just stuck in a suspended animation state of pure disbelief. This couldn't possibly be happening. The wave was so unfathomably large to me it might as well have been the sky scraper high wave from Deep Impact. I just sat there immobilized by terror as it broke about 30 feet in front of me creating a mountain of rapidly approaching whitewater.

I'm not sure why I didn't just bail my board but as I went to duck dive I instinctually turned sideways at the last moment like you would if you were about to get hit front on by a bus. The board was violently ripped from my hands immediately and I got the worst spin cycle tumbling of my life. When I came up I had just enough time to get a breath in before the next wall of whitewater hit. My board got creased and I was pretty spooked for a while afterwards but otherwise unscathed.

1696810116.0,Possible Torn Hip Labrum. MRI Clear. Very Painful. Been Months. Please Help!,"Hello,

I believe I torn my right hip labrum around February/March of this year. I probably didn't really figure this out until around July.

The only thing I can really remember is that I bought a new bike that was kind of like a BMX bike, barely did anything with it however, the cadence was extremely off. I also worked a lot out in the GYM and used the Elliptical. I do remember riding the Elliptical one time and pain kicked in around 20 min around the back of my right SI joint. I pushed through the pain for another 10 min because it wasn't that bad. Also, we did move around the March/April time frame, it was a light move but a move none the less. Actually, considering it was probably a pretty heavy move. Then lastly, the only thing I think I may have did was stretch it out too much with weights. I remember feeling like my right leg needed some stretching so I put a weight on it while sitting Indian style. Nothing crazy, just like a 5 LB or 10 LB in order to push it a little while holding it.

Not sure if any of this torn my labrum or not but fast forward to July. My right hip was hurting so bad to include my right SI joint that I went to a Back Doctor and a Hip Doctor. The Back Doctor was decent however, the Hip Doctor PA was extremely rude. I ended up getting an MRI on my Back and my Right Hip after taking regular X-Rays per the Back Doctor. Both MRI's are clear except for the right Hip does have a Minor Impingement from I believe a small bone spur that is digging into my Femur Ball that is trying to heal itself creating a Fluid Nodule over and over again.

No one really gave me any answers I think because they didn't know what to do. My MRI's came back clean with no visual tear and the hip doctor people blew me off. Fast forward a few weeks and again the hip pain was so intense I went to a different Urgent Care that is Orthopedics only.  I met an Angel there. A PA that looked at everything I had. My X-Ray's, MRI's, listen to my story, etc. They said they knew exactly what I had. A damaged internal hip because of a bone spur. They have a special MD that they refer this to and they perform this Surgery 24/7.

Hip Arthroscopy Surgery

I was re-leaved to have some kind of answers because no one else did. I went to go see this MD and they gave me a Steroid Cortisone Shot. It did help and the pain mostly subsided. I would say for about six weeks on the dot. Then I figure I would test it out and go for a walk and boy it came back hard core. I would say the pain when it is really pissed off is about an 8/9. Completely debilitating.  I went for a 30 min walk and afterwards I would have to lay down on the opposite side and ice my hip for 30 min to be able to even stand again.

Things I can no longer do:

\-Walk longer than 5 min

\-Run

\-Mow the Yard

\-Go on any day trip and walk around

So I went back to my MD and told them everything. They are 100% convinced this is a Texted Book case of a Labrum Tear and they have offered to preform the Surgery. This Doctor has done it 2000+ times and has Good Ratings. I have all the information and they are literally just waiting on my phone call to schedule the Surgery.

Preset Day

So naturally, I started researching this on the internet and low and behold THIS is a MASSIVE topic on the internet. Tons and Tons of people video logging it and talking about. Strangely, though doesn't seem like there is any FRESH information on this though. Everything is around 3+, 5+, or even 10+ years old. Does this mean that everyone currently having this problem is just getting the surgery and moving on. Not really talking about it anymore? Have the Doctors mastered this procedure now?

My findings were that you could have a really great surgery, be a lot better off than you were before however, you many never be 100%. Meaning have realistic expectations of what you are going to get out of Surgery. I am leaning towards this because I believe this is a lot better chance of at least being able to walk again. I mean I would rather have the option to walk again than not have the option. Meaning if the Surgery is not the best outcome, well I at least tried. I mean I can't walk right now.

However, I have also heard a lot of people try to not get the Surgery. They do admit they have sacrificed a lot and can no longer run or do activities but they manage their every day lives I believe getting by the best they can. I am not sure I like this option.

Then you have a couple of miracle stories to where some people say they have heal their labrum even though all evidence says that you cannot. I think one person said it took like 10 years. Seriously?

I am not sure I have the stamina or the capability to do this. I do want to try to the best of my ability.

Enter in.

PT - Physical Therapy

I have been in PT for 3 weeks now. I felt a little better, so much so I worked out at home my own way. Big Mistake. Completely took a few steps back with major pain. (I did a minor ab routine) I will not do that again. However, to me the pain is so great I want to say yes to surgery and get this over with. However, my mind is saying have you really gave PT everything you got first? Could you be one of those 20% people to heal themselves out of this without surgery?

Am I a big baby? I mean maybe people deal with much worse pain levels and even run through this kind of pain. Seriously? No Way. How?

Should I somehow become a super hero and fight though this pain and PT and beat this on my own somehow?

Here is my current thought process.

Try PT for another 4-6 weeks. If I make significant process. Delay Surgery.

I don't think I can make it and within 2-3 weeks out I am going to cave and schedule the surgery.

Pain Levels

1-2 - Almost constant throughout the day (Sometimes NASID Sometimes Not)

4-6 - Mid Day, office work around the job or house (bad days) (NASID)

7-8 - Mow the Yard, 15+ min walk, Day Trip (need immediate rest and ice, hot bath, NASID)

Help!

So please, what would you do? What have you done? What is the latest information regarding this? I just don't want to get the Surgery and find out that the Labrum Tear wasn't the actually problem. I mean sometimes I feel its a hurt ligament or other things like what is listed below:

\-Sacrotuberious Ligament issue

\-SI Joint issue

\-Pulled Groin

\-Anything else in the Pelvic Region?

\-IT Band

Side note, all blood work is clear, X-Ray's are clear, MRI's are clear. However, I know this Pain is real and not in my Head. I mean in either case they can clean up the bone spur, look around with the scope and fix any problems they find if I do the surgery. Thus far, I am leaning towards Surgery and maybe think I have 3-6 weeks of PT left in my mind in order for a Miracle to happen before I call and schedule the surgery.

I am just so tired of literally doing nothing except rest, ice and laying around. I know it will hurt if I do anything. I am doing PT 3 days a week, but is that enough? I am hoping I can get those few steps that I went back to a baseline of at least not hurting doing nothing.

I mean I could possibly do something if I ice that area, stack up on NASID's and do something minor but I will probably pay for it later.

You arrive to your freshly cleaned and waxed board, use the changing rooms, walk straight out the door over to the waves, surf, come back, leave your wet sandy stuff, shower, put your comfy clothes back on, drive home. And chill.


No taking your surfboard on/off the car, no changing out of your wetsuit in a parking lot or on the sand, getting your wet feet all sandy and then putting on socks (horrifying). No surfboard taking up 25% of the space in your home or Appartment.

Wanna start with one, then have multiple, each at the most popular surfing spots in San Diego, and maybe someday around the world. Just gotta find the perfect real estate location so it's nothing but a short walk to the waves. Will be difficult, but I believe In the idea.


If successful, will also include things like board waxing/cleaning staff, key fobs, I'll make it have beachy/tiki hut vibes, maybe even a sauna or hot tub.


Let me know what you guys think! Your response would be greatly appreciated",surfing

Me: Im 17, I‚Äôve been surfing for a few years and have moved to a 5‚Äô9 puddle jumper (~37 liters). I am 5‚Äô9 and 140 lbs and am decently athletic (I snowboard and skate very often and play tennis. I‚Äôm also a proficient wake surfer). I don‚Äôt usually have a problem catching waves, especially on more average/bigger days. I would also like to add, I surf in Oregon and wear a wetsuit surfing in cold water. Idk how much of an impact this really makes, but I‚Äôve heard ppl talk abt it. 

At this point I am working on progressing my top to bottom surfing and am looking for a board that I can ride in bigger and better waves, (on 4-5 foot days my puddle jumper feels bulky and the rail almost feels like it‚Äôs gonna skip out on steep drops. This is absolutely somewhat related to my level of surfing and it‚Äôs not fully the boards fault I‚Äôm sure, but it does feel like something with less volume could work well for me on those days?) 

I found a used 5‚Äô6 album twinsman (30 liters) for a great deal and am wondering if this board is going to feel like too drastic of a change, or if it‚Äôs going to progress my surfing in the way I want it to. Does anyone have experience with it and know if it makes a good daily driver for that average to good 4-7 foot range? my local surf shop recommended a pyzel phantom but new boards are expensive and i haven‚Äôt been able to find anything used.  

I want a board that is above my skill level so I can grow with it (I am also young and surfboards are not something I can find money for often). The board seems like it could be a great fit, I‚Äôd really appreciate any thoughts, or feel free to gaslight me into spending money if you hate the way these posts saturate the r/surfing feed. 

Tldr; album twinsman for first higher performance board, coming from grovelor. Also is 5‚Äô6 too low volume for 5‚Äô9 and 140lbs?  

Much love.

Edit: the twinsman is in great condition, has some minor pressure dents. $600.",surfing

1696610621.0,Healing from a traumatic surf accident,"It was my first custom-made fish. I was ordering from a local legend in shaping. We met, and he spent 
 better part of an hour talking to me, feeling out what I wanted, where I planned to surf it and in what types of waves, etc

Weeks went by. Expected delivery date passed. I gave it more time, and eventually called him. He told me he was behind due to workload, but that It would be soon. 

I finally got the call that my new board was ready, and I went to his shaping studio to pick it up. There were a couple other people there waiting to meet with the shaper, a couple of friends of his that were just hanging out, and his assistant. When he saw me enter, he looked up and smiled, excused himself from a conversation, and showed me to the board. There it lay, beautifully glistening beneath the lights. I walked over to it, and everyone in the room oohed and ahhed, commenting on its beauty.

I picked it up, held it above me to examine it and appreciate its beauty, when for some goddamn reason it slipped from my hands and fell right onto its tail, hitting the concrete floor with a sickening crack.

The room fell silent. I looked at the shaper. He looked at me with an expression that I can only describe as infinite disappointment and awe. I placed the board down onto a pair of saw horses and examined the tail. Cracked right through to the foam.

An otherwordly voice broke the silence. One of the guys in the room said loudly and with a laugh, ""Well, now that you got that out of the way go out and rip."" 

It was sage advice for sure. But at times, like now, the trauma of that accident still haunts me.",surfing

(1) 6'0 modern fish with twins. High wave count, fast carving rides, but 30% I feel like I dont have enough fin to hold when it barrels(2) 6'0 Dominator setup with thrusters. Medium wave count and I obviously turn easier and faster than the twin fish. When I do catch, 50% of the rides are good and 50% I get bucked off because the tail section feels too wide. Maybe this board isnt ideal for a wave this big. Or maybe I just need more practice on it?(3) 6'8 custom shaped, very narrow, 19"" wide with pulled in nose. Lower wave count but when it catches, I have far more control. It looks and feels like it was designed for a bigger wave so maybe this Im on the right track with this one.

(4) 8'2"" custom shaped swallow tail with quads. Down rails with chine, high rocker, heavily foiled. Wave count is very high, but the length and fin config prevent it from turning fast. More importantly, I'd rather improve my shorter-board skills, so scratch this one out.

I see boards like the Firewire Houdini, but these conditions are rare, so it seems silly to buy another board just for this wave type. Perhaps I should think about spreading my quiver out a bit. For example, have two 6'0 shortboards, one as a daily-driver and one higher-performance specs",surfing

I‚Äôve been looking at something like a quiver killer in wide dims at 5‚Äô11 or 6‚Äô0 for better surf and use as a semi step up, though I also want it to give me the extra control i dont get from the rocket wide even when its small and steep. Any other suggestions? Am looking for secondhand boards, so custom is not really an option. 

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10, paddle fit, 78kg on a good day. Not an amazing surfer but can do cutbacks, re-entries and pack tubes (still working on riding out of them).

&#x200B;

These pillow waves are soft and plump

Fat high tide slack and slump

With little peak but

Still somewhat

A chance for a sleepy swoop or pump

&#x200B;

These porridge waves are a bit of mush

Kinda lully with little push

Spoiled by the rising

Not surprising

But hoping for my own Blue Crush

&#x200B;

Here it comes from way outside

Wishes finally supplied

Horizon heaving

Eyes disbelieving

My crush is squeezing me inside

&#x200B;

These pummel waves are pound for pound

A pugnacious pugilistic mound

My body battered

Wits are scattered

But I think I‚Äôll go another round

&#x200B;

Again, again, and again some more

Neoprene me straight back to shore

Cheeks red glowing

A shameful showing

For tourists, locs, and kooks galore

&#x200B;

Ok, perhaps I am done after all,

With cocktail waves turned barroom brawl

Still a bit of thirst

But first

I think I hear a burrito call.

1696226660.0,Who has terrible eyesight? What's your experience?,"I surf alone 98% of the time. My eyesight is also really terrible, like I can't see something clearly 6 feet from my face. 
Surfing is the only thing other than sleep that i still do without glasses/ contacts. 

I wear my glasses down to the beach and choose where I'm going to paddle out and sit because when i take off my glasses my vision of the ocean just turns into an incoherent mess. Like I've gone down to check it without glasses and been like wow there's no one out and my mates will be like wtf dude, there's like 30 people out. 
Even when there are lots of other people in the water i rarely have an interaction with someone because i just can't see their face. I can just see a blurry blob. Over time I've basically just learnt to completely ignore people. Might sound like a jerk move but after years of saying hi to people only to realise they weren't even looking at me, or responding to someone only to realise they are looking past me talking to someone else, you just get sick of having awkward interactions.
For example, a couple months ago I was surfing a small point break with my partner, she is still learning. We were sitting behind the pack just taking small leftovers, i rode one in. As i was paddling back out I saw her paddleing out into the crowd. I whistled, got her attention and waved for her to paddle back to me. I didn't know why she decided to head out to the peak but she definitely wasn't at the level yet. Anyway, she hesitated to paddle back to me but she finally did and as she got near me i realised my terrible mistake. It wasn't my partner. It was a local Japanese man, different gender, different coloured board, different in every way except they were both wearing a hat and i couldn't tell the difference. I actually whistled at one of the locals and waved them into me. 
We had a good laugh but it was super embarrassing. 

Waves also come in blurry blobs but I've learnt to read the ocean well based on rises and falls on the horizon and changes in colour.

I actually really struggle to enjoy myself when I'm surfing with other people or interacting with them. 

Part of me really wants to start surfing with contacts, but it's already an expensive hobby and i worry about eye infections. Part of me wants to get some prescription surf goggles and turn into like a sort of kooky superhero.

But then there's also a part of me that appreciates the unknown. I love being able to zone out of everything and just be in my own little world. I was seriously anxious about surfing by myself for years, i always wanted to paddle out with a friend so i had a reference point for where i was but I'd usually lose them after one wave anyway and spend the session by myself. 

Now that I'm really comfortable reading the ocean from instinct and feel, I'm hesitant to get my vision back. But it does make surfing unfamiliar spots and rock walks/jumps difficult. 

I know that if i use vision i will never go back to not wearing my glasses. The same thing happened with skating. I couldn't skate wearing glasses for ages because it would throw my depth perception way off. But as soon as i got used  to it i stopped being able to skate without them. 

I actually used contacts for a surf a few years ago. I did it once and it was mind blowing, the clarity was out if this world. But at the time I didn't have more and i couldn't afford to keep buying them. I also lost one in that session.
 
I would love to hear people's experiences. 

Those who use contacts, do you use dailys and a new pair every session? Do you wear monthlys and just chuck them in the dishwasher? Do you still surf if you don't have contacts or if you lose one in the surf does that end the session? 

Does anyone wear prescription glasses/goggles?",surfing

Started surfing almost 20 years ago but had to take the past 5 years off after a nasty motorcycle accident messed up my shoulder pretty good. Brain remembers what to do but my body has been fighting me and I need a bit of extra paddle power due to my shoulder. Back into the swing of things this spring and no problems with cruisy cutbacks, but want to work back towards ""top to bottom"" surfing like I could (albeit not well) before my injury. 

My current ""daily driver"" is a 7'2 (50L) Chilli Mid Strength. It's been a stellar board but a lot to swing around. Also been on a 6'4 Rawson Alien (43L) a lot this summer - fast, very very flat, lots of paddle power, but in anything above chest high if I'm not getting in on the shoulder I've been getting hung up by the lack of nose rocker (burying the nose when trying to get on rail before hitting the flats). Before my injury my bigger day board was a 6'6 CI Black Beauty (35L) which I still have but haven't touched in many years. 

I'm hoping the Pyzalien2 XL in either a 6'0 (34L) or 6'2 (38L) would slot in somewhere well, fast with a good amount of paddle power but more rocker to handle a bit more size and be more maneuverable to progress on as I get back into the sport. 

Countering all this, I am far from surfing any of my boards to their full potential and beyond what I perceive to be a nose rocker issue with the Alien I'm sure I'm not being held back by my equipment at all.",surfing

I don't remember when at I last saw her, but must have been at least 5 years. I've always wonder what happened to her. I hope she didn't burn the wrong person and got murdered for it.

1696019088.0,New board suggestions (also dimensions),"Hello, I am looking to get a new board shaped (Lima - Peru). I am 1.74cm / 5 9 ft - 74kg/165 lbs

I currently surf an epoxy 5 7 (30.8 lt) gofish shaped from a local shaper which has helped my surfing a ton. I really like the speed down the line, the flow, and when I find it's sweet spot (2 - 4 ft) it really handles well. However, I think when it gets over over 5 feet it starts to struggle; I feel (maybe because of shape / because its epoxy) it starts lifting up, and in general, its limiting my progression (want to do a little more sharp turns).

I felt it struggled in this size of wave (6-7ft imo)

https://preview.redd.it/rmwiqh2ho8rb1.jpg?width=3456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5d38f820651bc284e335eb51987f946137a7857

Two weeks ago, I got a 5 6 (27. 7lt) ci twin pin shaped from a another local shaper (different from the first) for bigger waves (6ft) . Unfortuneatly, it didn't perform as I wanted (felt too small, didnt float nice, and paddling in for big waves was hard). I don't if I asked for dimensions too small for me (dimensions from william allioti video) or maybe the materials weren't as solid. I ended up dinging the bottom and ripping one of its fin box in a wipeout on my 4th session.

Because of this, I'm looking to shape a new more permformancy daily driver with the first shaper. Something that has a good paddle, flow down the line, lay backs and some vertical surf. Soemthing that can habdle bigger days, but also work in medium surf (3 - 8 ft). Im thinking of the cc lanesplitter or maybe album twinsman/light bender. Anyone have any experience with any of those boards or could recommed a shape I should try? People who owned seaside/gofish, what board would you recommend? Please take into account that this board will be made in epoxy.

**Litreage question:**

How much lt do you think I could cut for new daily driver. I feel like the 27.7 i ordered the twin pin was too litte, but I'm also skeptical that the material/product wasn't as solid. I'm thinking of around a 5 6 lane spitter with 28.4 lt, but I'm afraid I might be ordering too small again.

**TLDR**

1.74cm / 5 9 ft - 74kg/165 lbs looking for a new performancy daily driver that handle a little bit of bigger waves, but also work in medium surf (3 - 8ft). With speed down the line, flow and some vertical surfing. I'm transitioning from a 5 7 go fish.

I‚Äôm surfing around 8 years on and off but I‚Äôm really trying to get back into it and I‚Äôm loving it. 
I have a 5‚Äù7 with 26l and it‚Äôs super tricky and a bit too advanced for me. 
I also have a 5‚Äù10 short foamie which is very fun. 
The waves I surf are pretty mushy and weak most of the time on a beach break. 

Should I sell the 5‚Äù7 and get a fish as an all rounder or keep the 5‚Äù7 and get a fish and naturally progress into the high performance board?

1695674563.0,"UPDATE: ""I feel undergunned""... (funny surf story from this weeks hurricane swell).","Thought y'all might enjoy this. A few weeks back I made a post about feeling undergunned. Well, Hurricane Nigel swell hit Cornwall yesterday - and my dumbass thought it was a great idea to take out the 5'7 Psycho Nitro in legit 8-10ft Fistral (8 feet 15 seconds) - with a howling 30 mph offshore.

Jumped off the rocks and realized this was serious. Everyone was on 7-foot guns, and I was severely mistaken. Tried to paddle into a few bombs (I'm fairly familiar with how the waves work at Fiz, so didn't end up getting caught out at all as the period was so high you could time the sets fine).

After a while, decided all was hopeless and began the mission to paddle in. Fistral, like many other deep water beach breaks - is mushy on the big bombs, and absolutely detonates on the inside. So I hatched my plan. Wait for the massive set (sets were only 2 waves thankfully, every \~15 mins), then gun it and take one on the head and in.

So - after the next set, I get my head down and gun it to the shore. It's a solid 300 feet to paddle in, with nuts currents but I just know as long as I take a 6 footer on the head, it'll be fine. 

Just my luck - a freak set hits as soon as I'm in the middle of the impact zone. Turn around, gun it try and get under them. First one is a medium 6 footer - thankfully just get under it.

The second one - I was not so lucky. This freak of satan, dredging, evil, lurching 10 footer was baring it's teeth directly on me. You know when you just know, instantly that you're fucked? Like you don't even bother? I distinctly remembered laughing outloud and exclaiming this is where I die.

Unlike every single massive set wave - this one broke top to bottom, full barrel. I make the business decision that against 99% of Reddit's advice, I'm ditching my board and swimming under on this one.

I distinctly remember seeing the lip launching down on me as I sink under, and just mentally preparing for the beating of a lifetime. Bear in mind - I haven't even been surfing 2 years yet. And that's not 2 years Hawaii - that's 2 years in the UK. We don't get hurricanes. So as I'm underwater - I'm pretty sure I'm about to be eating my own feet.

I feel the initial impact like a truck to my back, but somehow - I didn't get sucked back over and detonated. My leash didn't snap either. I got that super lucky trick where you get sucked back and spat out the back. 

Genuinely surprised I was alive - I went to grab my board. Got it underneath me, and adrenaline was pumping so hard I went to paddle for the smaller 5 foot wave to get to the shore - as I pressed down on the board to get in, it folded in my hands. That last wave had landed directly on the stringer and decimated it. I cant imagine what taking the direct impact of that wave on my head would have felt like.

Thankfully - I body boarded the next white water in, and was out for another day. Borrowing a friends 6 foot shortboard now (yay for adequate board length).

I've now decided I have to actually take big(ger) wave surfing as something serious - and get the bloody equipment for it. Everyone was out on a 7 foot gun, don't take a fucking toothpick out in serious surf. Respect the dang ocean. I think it's kinda easy to gaslight yourself into still being a beginner surfer - so you don't need ""serious"" board. But the only way you're gonna get that experience when you're ready is to give it a shot. This power and size is \*right\* on the edge of my comfort zone. I'd have been shitting it - but I could have swam in had my leash broke, and the sets were very very lully. Had it have been any bigger, and any less mushy on the sets - no way would I have gone.

But yes. Lesson learned. Try not to send it too hard, folks. Great story tho - and I did quite enjoy the walk up the beach with a folded board as onlookers look at you like you've just 1v1'd tyson fury.",surfing

Some men were shirtless and wearing shorts (I'm assuming it's for the board short convention the street over), neoprene banana hammocks (Europeans must travel well!) and some even not wearing any clothes at all (I think it's so they can try on new wetsuits quickly and efficiently) 

I was loving the vibe so I stripped off my Smartwool shirt, Patagonia pants and my Allbirds and tried on some wears.  There were some wetsuits that were constricting, but they definitely seemed to retain heat pretty well. 

My favorite wetsuit was a long john that didn't have the middle part of the lap/buttox area, which the owner said allowed for ""easy entry and exit and an increased ride performance"".

1695400486.0,Wetsuit sizing issues for a skinny person with broad shoulders,"New surfer, can't seem to fit into any wetsuit properly. I come from a climbing background and I'm built like an upside down triangle: wide shoulders, smaller chest, even smaller waist. I've tried 4 wetsuits and feel insane.

# Measurements

* **Height**: 5'7""
* **Weight:** 150lbs
* **Waist** (at widest part near belly button when sitting down): 33"" .. 31.5"" standing up normally.
* **Chest** (at widest part - middle of pec): 41.5""
* **Shoulders** ([straight across back of neck](https://tailor.fandom.com/wiki/Shoulder_Width_(measurement)) \- end points are middle of shoulder): 22""
   * deltoids literally stick out sideways, adding to this measurement in practice

I've tried 2 O'Neill wetsuits and a couple of no-name ones from Amazon. Here's their size chart: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V7D9N1F?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details&th=1&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V7D9N1F?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1&psc=1)

The most recent and best fitting wetsuit I tried was a ""large-short"" O'Neill Epic. The legs, crotch, waist, and lower chest fit **perfectly.** Once I tried zipping up the neck it was like I was wearing a corset. Restricted breathing and movement.

I'm worried the next size up (XL short) is going to be baggy around the waist because its lowest measurement (35"") is 2"" wider than my actual waist. An XL might be very long too, considering I'm only 5'7.

Any advice would be great. Local surf shop didn't have any more options but there's another one I might wander over to a few towns over.",surfing
1695420876.0,Help me pick a Twin Fin Set-Up,"So I am getting a new custom fish and I am looking at different fin options for weak mushy beach break waves.  In the winter we can get some nice waves, but we also get a lot of wind slop.  This is going to be my all around board.  It is a 6‚Äô4 big guy fish - I am 200 lb and almost died from COVID.  I was in a coma on a vent for 2 months and supposed to have a lung transplant.  I still have some lung scarring so a little extra float is unfortunately needed until I lose some weight and hopefully build my lungs back.  If I get back into shape it will be a great grovel board or a fantastic point break board.  The break is a little point breakish as it wraps around the jetty on a decent swell.

I have surfed for 30 years and can carve well and I have always been a powerful surfer so I am leaning towards a larger fin.  In my old fish I had some Mark Richards style fins (before FCS marketed the MR fins) with a small glasses in nubster style trailer.  It was more of a performance style fish that I had custom made in 2001 before we had so many fin options.  The board was like magic, but it is just to small for me at this point.  The new board will be a larger version of my old high performance style fish.

The fins I am looking at are the Britt Merrick Twin Fin, Mick Fanning Twin Fin, MR Free Ride, MR twin Fin and the Machado Keel.  I want something that will help beat out section and give me a little extra lift and drive while still allowing for vertical surfing.  Right now the BMT, MF and Free Ride seem like the best choices.  I would love to hear other people‚Äôs experiences.",surfing
1695332426.0,Do locals get to drop in on non-locals?,"Was at a middling beach break I go to frequently about 40 minutes from my home. One other guy paddles out, and on the first set wave that comes through he blatantly drops in on me. When he paddles back out, I asked him if he looked before he went. He immediately responded with ""where are you from"" and then ranted about how he lives right on the beach, how non-locals don't get to tell him how to surf, how we're lucky that they (locals) let us (non-locals) surf there. Who was in the wrong? 

I'm fine with locals regulating a break in a low-key way if there are lots learners / assholes in the lineup. But I don't think living closer to the beach than someone else should give you the right to ignore basic surf etiquette. ",surfing

1695315420.0,"Got scared, went home.","So I'm on a surf trip with my wife and 6 month old baby, neither of whom surf. I gotta say, it's really intimidating to roll up to a break to hop in for a session. I thought I'd get a sunset session in last night, at a spot that I had been to a couple times, at low tide. This time was high tide and while getting in was easy, getting out looked like it could be kooked pretty hard. I stood with my wettie on, board in hand, and watched. Conditions looked pretty good, head high at a perfect right hand point/reef setup, slightly choppy, nothing I can't handle. I watched a couple guys battle the rip for easily 20 minutes while waiting for a wave to bring them to the little patch of sand among rocks. Another guy timed the regular spot perfectly and hopped out no worries. Light was fading and I just decided to no-go. I likely would have been fine but I really don't want to be the guy to do something dumb. I guess more paddle fitness would give me more confidence, and more open water swimming practice, 'cause that shit is difficult. I can swim a kilometer in a pool without too much difficulty but swimming in the ocean is way harder! My home break is boat access and cold af so I don't get practice swimming in beach break or navigating rocky ins and outs. I've been kinda down on myself about not hopping in but the spot is known for being pretty challenging. I'm used to being able to push myself really hard at alpine climbing and ski mountaineering but man, surfing is so humbling. I'm trying not to suck at it, and sometimes I feel like I don't, but then it makes me set my cup down like nothing else. I guess that's what makes it so rewarding. Thanks for attending my Ted talk.

TLDR;

Do's:

1. Listen to lifeguards
2. Be Respectful to the regulars/locals - Be nice
3. Bring the right equipment - everyone is surfing to progress and have fun - be prepared - wear a leash.
4. Know what the swell is doing. (one minute the swell can suck, but an hour later it can be overhead - know the forecast)
5. Stretching and warming up - from a 29 y.o. talking about preventing injuries
6. Know your limits - ""if in doubt, don't go out""
7. take a lesson - show aloha to north shore coaches like in Haleiwa
8. Time your paddle out - when to paddle out ""very tricky to master...everyone I know professional surfers still get smoked...burn so much more energy than you needed to.""
9. Take turns with the people your surfing with - if you just caught a wave, let someone else go
10. Please clean up your trash - ""We as surfers need to conscious of how we treat the beach""

Don'ts

1.  Don't paddle into a surfers way when they are on a wave - ""the most frustrating thing as a surfer...I would rather take a whole set on the head to stay out of someone's way""
2. Don't paddle out around everyone and try to get a wave - don't paddle out into a group and take the first wave that comes in
3. Don't Surf Pipeline - you will be competing the the best surfers in the world who will be having a bad day
4. Don't snake anyone on a wave - paddle around someone to get deeper to call them off. ""you don't do it"" 
5. Don't drop in on people - ""you can put someone in harm's way...especially in the North Shore you could hurt someone or hurt yourself...and you could get beat up for it.""
6. Don't paddle for a wave and pull back - ""if you paddle for a wave and you don't go, to me in my mind, that's an automatic, ok this guys not going to go on any waves, he is not serious about catching waves...don't even paddle for a wave if you're not serious about going.""
7. Don't Panic - ""it is very easy to start panicking...relax, stay calm, get some breaths in.""
8. Don't drive fast on the back roads -Especially on Ke Nui Road on the North Shore since it is a residential street with families and kids that live there.",surfing

As I surf in coldish waters, the next one I got with the external liquid seams (no tape inside). I couldn't tell if indeed was any warmer, and 2 years later all the liquid seam is cracking and beneath it there are some holes where the panel are glued. 

Do you feel the liquid seams restrict movement compared to GBS w/ tape? I wonder if it just makes me work harder and not provide that much extra insulation.

We already know we can steal your car/truck/van if its under the wheel or in your 'trailer hitch safe'. 

Solution:  Almost all car manufacturers have an 'emergency' key that comes out of your FOB by pushing a little button. You bring THAT key with you in your trunks (usually have a handy string to loop around it so you don't lose it) or your wetsuit key pocket. 

Google '**how to remove emergency key for (YEAR MODEL MAKE) FOB**' and you will learn how to get your little key out. 

How to lock my doors if the FOB is in the car? Your manufacturer knows this needs to happen. You take the emergency key with you and leave the FOB in the car.

Lock all the non driver doors manually then lock the driver door with your little emergency key and you are all set!

No more losing your keys up your prison purse for the Dr. to retrieve or losing them all in the sand or watching the local homeless guy driving away in your windowless ~~molester~~ van.

there are times where i've kept low all the way to the lip and the expanded and kept speed through the top turn but i'm still mostly just speeding / pumping up and down.

i guess the best ""feeling"" i've gotten so far is that i should go into the top turn with enough speed that i might come off the wave (which would even be a ""win"").  i might be getting too far outside the break instinctively on bigger waves to ""stay safe"", but instead should be angling closer to the break with more speed.  obviously every wave and situation is different.  i'm assuming people get what i'm saying.

More detail: earlier this year I was riding boards around 28L but have recently dropped liters and feeling more maneuverability. I buy 2nd hand boards as I seem to progress to smaller boards every few months. My current favorite is a [Dalton Jett](https://lostsurfboards.co.nz/fun-boards) (5'7 x 19 x 2.2 and 25.8L) twin plus trailer that felt great from the first wave. It seems to work well in the often soft beach breaks of Mount Maunganui (New Zealand)  but also felt great at the point break in Raglan on a head high day. With this board I am catching waves easily and it feels very stable for pop up. It's fast and locks into the face when needed, like taking a deep drop and getting down the line. But it's also easy to turn when I want to. I'm still developing my cutbacks and hacks and feel like this board will allow me to work on those with confidence.

I've been frequently riding twins (sometimes with trailer, sometimes not) the last 1.5 years but I'm wondering if a thruster would help my progression more, maybe more predictable through turns? With twins I sometimes don't know how hard to drive with the back foot, catching a rail if I push too hard. So I've had my eye out for thrusters and recently found an Inferno 72 (5'9 x 18 3/4 x 2 3/8 and 26.4L). I haven't quite gelled with this board. It feels a bit shaky when popping up, I expect because it is the narrowest board I've ridden. I could probably get used to this though it also feels difficult to turn once on my feet. Maybe this is bad technique. But with the Jett responding like I want, I wonder if the Inferno is too long or too big for me. Perhaps a 5'7 or 5'8 in this model would be better.

The Jett is working great so I'm thrilled to have that. It's meant for 1-5ft waves and does seem to excel in that size and can go if it's soft. I'd love to find a thruster to experiment with on bigger/hollower waves in the 2-8ft range. Should I be looking more at 24 liters for my weight?

I'd love some thoughts on twins vs thrusters for progression and when is the right time to drop liters.",surfing

1695094220.0,Adult learner shortboard diary entry 0,"Tactical Brain-dump incoming...

31m 5'8 135lbs surfing 7'6 egg for 2 and a bit years, picked up a 6' Chilli rare bird hybrid shortboard at 32.5L and here's how it went.

&#x200B;

* Session 0 - fun but crowded 1-2ft conditions at local beach break. My aim was to become vaguely familiar with lying on and paddling on the board, I noticed just how specific the sweet spot for paddling is, having my chest a few cm either direction had the nose either sticking way up or bogging underwater.

&#x200B;

* Session 1 - Glassy 2-3ft at remote beach break. During this session I caught some really fun waves, the stand out was a wave where I kept a high line and powered along, noting that applying some pressure on my rear foot really acted like an accelerator in comparison to my 7'6 which feels a bit more steady. Surfed for 3 hours and my arms were really burning and weak toward the end of the session, it's been a long time since I really felt like that because my bigger board paddles easier.

&#x200B;

* Session 2 - Very low period 3-4ft messy waves with a large amount of refraction and warping on the surface. This session was a brutal wake up call for me because I struggled to maintain a good paddling position due to the unstable water surface. Also, the frequent walls of white water had me quite gassed from having to duckdive often, I think my technique is currently inefficient.

&#x200B;

* Session 3 (Today) - Again, very messy low period but bigger, maybe 4-5ft. It was a mistake to take  shortboard out, I knew the swell was building but I didn't anticipate it being as big as it was. A positive thing is that I had less trouble maintaining a good paddling position this time, and I had some effective duckdives under the larger waves which really felt amazing in comparison to doing turtle rolls on my 7'6.

A huge mistake I made during today's session is that once I made it out back, I immediately went for a wave instead of waiting to fully catch my breath, I was way over eager and I paid dearly for it; I was too deep and went over the falls and took a couple wave hold down, which ignited a small amount of panic in me, as I was already a bit out of breath. I called it after that and after noticing how far I'd drifted sideways along the beach.

Other things I've learnt so far..

* I'm not riding the wave much differently to how I would on my 7'6, aside from slightly sharper cutbacks. This possibly means I'm not at the required skill level to be on a shortboard yet, I'm not going as top to bottom as the board could potentially go, and I'm still not sure if the shortboard will help me learn to surf in a more vertical style.
* I did sacrifice some time spent actually riding waves so far, due to misjudging the amount of paddling required or being too far from the peak, where my 7'6 would normally catch waves easily.
* The extra amount of exertion required on the shortboard threw off my ability to calculate my comfort zone, the waves today were NOT bigger than I'm comfortable with, but my tiredness made the hold downs more scary.
* Shortboards are very fun!

1694983720.0,"Surfed an unfamiliar, localized break for the first time, caught waves, and didn't get in any fights.","Listen up, kooks. I wrote this awhile back but hesitated to post it.  Maybe now is the right time, so here‚Äôs a counter-narrative to all the toxic tales of localism that tend to trend here (especially lately). This story is all true.  Every single word of it.

Earlier this year, I surfed a very localized break for the first time, and I didn't get in any fights.  No one swore at me.  No one burned me.  No one slashed my tires or waxed my windshield.  Not only that, but I got some great fucking waves on a day when it was shitty almost everywhere else for miles around.  How'd I pull off such a miracle?   And, more importantly, how can you?  Well, youngbloods, let me tell you a tale...

I pulled up to the spot and everyone's truck was bigger than my ride, and they all seemed to know each other.  And everyone looked me over when I rolled up.  I said 'hi' and 'good morning' and 'whassup' to *everyone* that looked my direction.

A couple of guys were already in the water, but half a dozen or so were standing around the overlook gauging the conditions.  I ambled over and took a seat next to the oldest guy in the group, gave him a nod, and *kept my mouth shut.*  We just watched the ocean together.  And one by one, guys toddled off to suit up until it was just me and the old man.

We talked surf, discussed the water, and agreed that the waves were better there than anywhere else along the coast that day.  As if to confirm our observations, some bigger OH sets came through and produced a clean, meaty wall. Somehow the swell seemed to focus on this one spot, and the same wind that made other spots blown out was blowing sweetly offshore.  As he talked, I listened and watched how guys made it out to the lineup, where they positioned, who was getting rides, and which set waves seemed to hold up best.

Then, I took my time suiting up and made my way down to the beach.  No hurry, no rush.  The old guy was already there, and after a few stretches, we paddled out together.  And for the next 30 minutes, I didn't paddle for shit.  I sat wide, and I watched.  I got my bearings in the water and made mental notes of who caught what, where.

Eventually, a set swung wide and I was in perfect position.  I turned to go, but a guy inside of me (closer to the beach but further from the peak) was paddling too.  He had already gotten several waves, and I was in the priority position.  So what did I do?  I fucking backed off and let him have it.

It was a sick wave, and he made good work of it.  I felt a tinge of jealousy and, despite my fear that my entire session might look like that, I complimented him anyway when he made it back out to the lineup.  And the next wave that came?  No one hassled me for it.  The lineup watched as I stroked in and caught my best wave of the year.  And from that point on, I was in the rotation.

About an hour later, I missed one of the best outside set waves of the session.  A couple of guys sitting further inside missed it too *because of me.*  They thought I was gonna get it, so they backed off.  As I hung my head, I heard one of them yell something towards me, and I immediately thought, ""Fuck, here it comes.""  I raised my hands and apologized for wasting it.  He yelled again, ""No, I said *damn, you almost had it.* Don't worry, you'll get the next one!""

But I didn't get the next one.  In fact, I let a few go through to the other guys that had been waiting.  And *then* I caught another to finish out a great session.

**TLDR** \- **went to a localized break for the first time, didn't act like an entitled ass or an anti-social goon, respected others, apologized when I fucked up, had the right board and abilities for the conditions, and ended up having a great session with no drama**

What kooks often fail to realize is that every break or region has a different culture, and that not every lineup shares the same culture as their home break.  I‚Äôm a pretty average surfer but I‚Äôve gotten waves at some localized breaks even when I look nothing like the locals or might not even speak the language.

In most cases, there‚Äôs no big secret trick.  Do your abilities match the spot?  Are you on suitable equipment for the wave?  After that, it just requires spending a little time observing the scene, trying to make a human connection to others, and showing some humility and respect.

And, especially when you‚Äôre traveling, this includes when you‚Äôre outside of the water too.  Because there‚Äôs a good chance that you‚Äôve already made an impression in the community before you even paddle out.  Kooks will act rude to their server or their driver, or harass the local women, or just act loud and obnoxious, and then be surprised when they paddle out the next morning and catch shit from the locals in the lineup.  

Moral of the story? Sure, sometimes it won't matter what you do because some assholes are undoubtedly gonna be assholes no matter what.  But if you don‚Äôt just bust on to the scene like a self-centered dickhead, you can *probably* avoid aggro in the water 99% of the time.  Of course, YMMV.  ",surfing

1694976994.0,"Been surfing the same spot for 8+ years and finally ran into localism(Westport, Wa) and in need of a sanity check","So it‚Äôs a beautiful day at a not so frequented spot (lefts looked super fun)in Westport, Wa, I paddle out and sit in the lineup on the shoulder waiting my turn. As the sets roll in all i do is turn my board waiting to see if the dudes with priority don‚Äôt make it then I‚Äôd go in case they miss it. They make it and I‚Äôm just admiring other surfers having a good time. Well they all go, then I lineup, about to turn and go for a wave and they yell at me and then this dude goes off saying I was ‚Äúshoulder hopping‚Äù except I didn‚Äôt drop in on anyone and the guys that had priority went. I told him I let everyone go and then he started yelling at me telling me he owned the spot which I tell him ‚Äúno one owns the fucking ocean‚Äù which judging my his initial demeanor I shouldn‚Äôt have said that cause I knew he was already heated. This caused him to go over the edge and I finally decided juice wasn‚Äôt worth the squeeze and paddled out at a different spot.

My question is was I in the wrong by chilling on the shoulder waiting my turn and then turning my board getting ready to go if they didn‚Äôt make it? I‚Äôve done that at plenty of other spots (Hawaii, Bali, Costa Rica, PNW) with no issue. Also I just wanted to vent

I bought the RRIPS Fins so could fiddle around with the placement as designed, and tend to run it as a quad.
My general understanding is that if I pull all the fins back, it will give a little more hold and draw out turns, whereas further forward fins loosen the board up a bit.

The question is what if you moved the front fins up but pulled the rear fins back? Or vice versa? So you played with the separation between the quad set up itself? I don‚Äôt really have a solid enough understanding of water physics to grasp how that might potentially change the ride!

Ultimately I‚Äôm just gonna try and play with it all, but I‚Äôd love some surfing bro science to unpack these wacky fin boxes!",surfing

1694807664.0,"Beginner: Buying a Bobby Quad, What size is best for me?","Heya everyone, as the title indicates, I'm purchasing a Channel Islands Bobby Quad today, and have a few different lengths to choose from.

I am 6' tall, 190lbs, and have relatively weak paddle strength.  I'm a beginner, (I just recently started getting up and riding straight on a 6'6 Odysea Skipper, in 2-4' wave conditions), and I'm looking for a board to transition me to fish/shortboard lengths.

Between a 6', 6'2, 6'4 and 6'6, what size Booby Quad would serve me best as a One Board Quiver?  I have intentions of developing my skills further, so I'd like the board to have enough foam to allow me to get into waves easily while my paddle strength is still lacking, though I'd like there to be room for it to remain a fun board for me as I further my capabilities and experience.

Without any guidance, I'm leaning towards the 6'6 with 47L of buoyancy just because all of my experience to date has been with high volume foam boards.  Is there any downside to the larger/thicker board?  My main desire of purpose for this board is to be a daily rider and allow me to move from beginner to intermediate!

Thank you for your time, consideration, and thoughtful responses in advance!  Looking forward to hearing from yall!",surfing
1694712321.0,"Waves took me farther from the shore than I expected, and I was clueless about what to do next","Hello everyone,

I recently had a harrowing experience that was, admittedly, due to my lack of experience. I attempted to reach the green waves in conditions that were nearing stormy. After some time, when I looked back, I found that I had been swept away by the current, placing me distressingly far from the shore. Panic quickly took over, especially as exhaustion set in and I doubted my ability to swim back. One thought did provide a glimmer of hope - the potential SOS signal on my watch. At one point, I even considered letting go of my surfboard, but thankfully decided against it.

Thankfully, I managed to get back to the shore on my own. After the incident, I wanted to familiarize myself with the SOS feature on my watch for future reference. To my surprise, my Garmin watch doesn't seem to have this capability.

  
This was a valuable learning experience for me. I'd like to ask the community: What should one do if caught in a similar situation in the future? What's the best strategy if you're being pulled further out to sea? Additionally, are there any reliable SOS devices designed for such situations that you would recommend?",surfing
1694705714.0,Multiple Shoulder dislocations (latarjet surgery),"What‚Äôs up friends! I have read through all the different posts about this topic and still felt the need to post. I want to start off saying I cannot express how much I appreciate the internet for things like this, and any comments are GREATLY appreciated :)

Since I was 15 (I am 26 now) I have had reoccurring dislocations with my left shoulder. Obviously as a kid I didn‚Äôt PT like I should have (I also wish someone would have forced me into surgery maybe?) but regardless I have once again ended up back in a position where I am afraid to move my body. 

For the past three months I‚Äôve diligently performed a program called ‚ÄúBullet Proof Shoulders‚Äù from an awesome dude named Trevor Hash. It has tons of animal movements and hanging exercises that had my shoulder feeling the best it‚Äôs ever been since the first dislocation. I unfortunately did a pec stretch incorrectly and boom there it went again.

I now am confident I want to try surgery even tho I will probably be paying it off for the rest of my life (but who cares if it fixes my problem?) I am insanely diligent with PT and very conscious about good posture and muscle recruitment. This injury has taught me so much, and if I can get my shoulder to the point of pushing through pain after surgery doing PT for a working shoulder I will fu$&ing do it 100000X over.

So please share your experience with latarjet surgery or anything similar. 

Thanks again :) -Zach",surfing
1694714970.0,Too fat? Too Slow? Positioing? Behind on Waves,"Trying to figure out what might be driving some of my recent NorCal ""performance issues.""  Been surfing a few times (2-3x) a week.  When waves get bigger and faster (say head high+), I find myself falling behind sections particularly after bottom turn.  I've noticed that on about half of my waves, when I'm making my bottom turn the wave is already crashing in front of me, and I have to straighten out or jump over the breaking wave.

My main suspicion is that I'm getting into the wave too late and maybe my pop up is a bit slower than it needs to be.  I can work on my pop up, but I still think that the late element might be something else.

Why might I be too late? I think it's because I'm a heavier guy.  I weigh 210+ (I'm 6'1), and due to NorCal currents/power, I find that I need more foam (average volume is 39-42L).  I've gone down in foam size (34L-36L), but paddling gasses me.  

My hypothesis is that because I have more foam, and because I'm heavier, I need to be deeper in the pocket and catch waves later.  I find that a lot of times I get sucked up the wave (from more foam) and while I can eventually paddle/drop in, it's nearly always critical.  I've seen many times guys smaller than me, positioned more on the shoulder and STILL getting into the wave before I would ever dream of.

Am I that weak?  Will losing weight help with this?  Am I just popping up too slow here?  Having a bigger board helps for sure (I get in nice and early with my log), but going much larger has it's own drawbacks (duck diving, control, steep faces, etc.)

Just wondering if anyone else whos on the heavier side has witnessed this, and how they were able to adjust accordingly.

I would say I'm an advanced beginner, been surfing for almost 1 year, can catch most waves, ride down the line on the face, still no bottom/top turns yet.

I've been surfing on a 7'0 (49L) but I've been struggling this summer on smaller days to catch waves consistently (most likely because of positioning and inefficient paddling I reckon)  but I really want to maximize fun, so was thinking to get a bigger board for those days.

Would something like this ([TORQ FUN V+ 7'8 (64L)](https://freewavesurfacademy.co.uk/shop/torq-mod-fun-78-v/)) worth it to get on top of my other mid or will it be redundant and I won't feel much difference?

1694534837.0,I present to you the McCoy Lazor Zap,"Every time I go to the beach I get stopped by some experienced surfer to ask about my board, or discuss how it won 2nd place 4 times in the World Surfing Titles. I've been told ""you should not be riding that board"", ""Never get rid of that board"" and ""you could sell that and get two new boards"".

Look, I'm a kook, I've been riding on and off 5 years, but I'm not great. I got this board as partial payment for cleaning out some affluent guys warehouse (it was just sitting on a ledge, rotting away). I love this board, but it's pretty beat up. I'd like to reshape it or get a new one (same design) because I absolutely love how it rides (I've tried all sorts of shapes and sizes of other boards, and this is my all time favorite). 

I just wanted to post on here to see if this board means anything to anyone, one guy told me I **needed** to contact Newport Surf Company and send them pictures. Unfortunately, they don't seem to exist anymore. So, here I am, on reddit, looking for information or advice.

1694555672.0,The M.O.A.R. rack. (Mother of all racks),"For those that live far from surf, like to do all of the things when you are on the road, and run a truck camper because you can't afford #vanlife here is a solution for you. In spring or fall in the PNW it's not unrealistic to do these 3 sports on a single short trip (an obvious application would be squamish/north shore riding, whistler skiing, and tofino surfing). But makes sense in Washington Oregon and California as well when it's not on fire. 

This is a velocirax 6 bike carrier with the central 2 slots removed. Initially I just used a block surf strap system centrally but dealing with the straps was annoying. Totally works though if you are in a budget. Verified for over a few thousand miles of rough driving.  Today I installed the Inno racks Inna446 which is a ratcheting locking rack for boards. I had to get creative with extra long bolts since it was designed for factory crossbars on suvs, but after making some shims and other creative liberties it turned out excellent and currently still accommodates 4 bikes. 

In fall velocirax is releasing their ski attachment which will allow me to have 2 bikes on one side, 3 boards centrally, and skis on the other side with all of it locked except for the skis. 

I add a ratchet strap over to minimize the slight movement of the rack when on rough roads or long trips. 

I've used it on boards up to 9'6. The camper blocks 90+ percent of the wind, and boards loaded bottom towards the rack makes the wind push right over the rocker of long boards. For ease of loading sometimes I put a wood board just strapped to the base of my velocirax as a platform for ease of one person loading.",surfing

1697236462.0,Matuse wetsuit owners - fit question,"I just took receipt of a Matuse Scipio (3/3) chest zip wetsuit and am have some fit concerns. Communication with Matuse has been slow and I need to make a decision on whether to keep or exchange in time for a trip that departs in 10 days.

I'm in that no man's land between L, LT, and XL and in many cases end up finding a really good fit when sizing down. 

For reference I'm 6'0"" / 200lb and an O'Neill L fits perfectly. Per their size chart I'm on the borderline in height and over in weight. XL has gaps all over (armpits, backs of knees, lower back, etc) and LT is way too long in arms and legs. 

The Matuse is proving to be a challenge which is compounded by the fact that I was only able to order 1 size option. Based on feedback from Matuse I ordered the XL and while it does fit I'm having two  issues:

1. There is some bunching in the armpits and above the elbows.
2. The rear of the collar is pulling away from my neck a bit. I can get it to lay flat if I pull the back of the suit up, but it resets to this position once I bend forward a few times. I suspect that once in the water the back of the suit will reset itself a bit and this will smooth out. 

Here are some images which illustrate: [https://imgur.com/a/JPWbFe7](https://imgur.com/a/JPWbFe7)

On top of that while the suit is definitely form-fitting and generally tight to the skin it's not *TIGHT* (like compressively tight) as I was expecting from a number of comments referencing Matuse and Yamamoto suits in general. In fact it was relatively easy to get on and off which is in stark contrast to my exiting 4/3 and 3/2 suits which are a bit of a struggle to get off the shoulders. 

So the question is whether or not the issues I'm having are enough to be concerned that the suit is going to be a leaky, cold, flushing mess. 

If I size down I'm pretty confident that the bunching in the armpits will resolve, but the collar is making me a bit concerned. The suit would also be compression-tight, which I'm OK with as long as it stretches and molds to fit.

If you have some experience with Matuse suits and how they tend to fit please let me know!

**Tl;dr:** Concerned about some fit issues with a Matuse Scipio (see image link above) and whether or not they will cause real problems in actual use. Keep it and surf it or send it back for an L or LT?

1697035986.0,how to get over fear of waves,"so this might be a slightly different post since I am not a surfer but thought you could all help me since this getting swept up by waves is a regular occurrence for any surfer.

I'll try to keep it short: I was in biarritz (atlantic ocean) in july when I went to the beach to go swimming. the waves were horrendously high and it was not recommended to go in but there were many people in the water anyway (+surfers in the distance).

I was pretty scared but thought it was one of those moments where I just had to take the leap and it would be fine. the waves seemed fine one moment and then out of control the next (unpredictable basically) so I stood at the beach for a while before running in.

first wave when I went in was okay, when the second one approached there were two children at the top and all I thought was cool theyre gonna fall onto my face and break my nose.
no way of even attempting to swim under the wave as there were too many people in the water.
so I got the washing maschine treatment, immediately let go of my sunglasses (4 weeks old and worth $90).
second wave didn't hit me as hard, after that I was washed up back on the beach.

I could hardly speak after, swallowed some salt water that also went up my nose, had a ton of sand in my swimsuit/hair/ears, I was basically in shock.

and ever since I keep thinking back and wish this hadnt happened. has anyone ever made a similar experience?
it feels like I'm horribly scared of the ocean now. I've always had a lot of respect for the tides and the power that the water holds but it seems some deep trust in me just broke.
and ive been pushed into the sand before by smaller waves/closer to the beach but this time it was in deep waters where I couldnt even stand/ was pushed down several meters.

I figured since surfers get swept up in waves much bigger than what I was subjected to some of you might be able to offer some advice.

1697063230.0,"Who do you think should've won the 2005 title, Kelly or Andy?","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVTR2QVXpTI&ab\_channel=WorldSurfLeague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVTR2QVXpTI&ab_channel=WorldSurfLeague) I was watching the Andy Iron's documentary, kissed by god. I'm not sure who won, but I gotta say all it did was make me fall in love with Kelly Slater even more. What a fucking guy, somehow many years ago I thought he was a bit of an asshole, but man people are just jealous as hell, he might be one of the people I admire the most, as a person first, as a surfer second.

UNRELATED RANT INCOMING:

The high five with Rob Machado for example, I don't believe for a second he masterminded that move to get priority, and when he told Andy at the final that he was his brother no matter what, then again, I think he's just that lovable guy. And they show that in Andy's documentary, Kelly was a nice guy, that of course was competitive, but he was the guy you could bring home to your parents. Andy was the mean guy that would get depressed if he lost and would talk about crushing Kelly's dreams and whatnot. (I know he was bipolar though, but it doens't change those facts). Kelly admits he told him he was old, and bald and over the hill, that's to me what horrible sportmanship is like. But to say to a guy that you love him as a brother regardless of who wins that's amazing.

Plus of course if you were going to do that, you'd do it at the final. I think Kelly is just so real and honest that some people have a hard time understanding that and wanted to desperately seek hidden intentions and motives.

&#x200B;

By the way I completely hate Andy Iron's girlfriend, sure, she didn't know he had a world title, but she met him and ""fell in love"" after he won it, that's what I consider a coincidence, and the way she talks about Kelly  especially just makes me cringe

&#x200B;

And idk, so it's hard to judge the contest given that I'm definitely biased towards Kelly. But what do you guys think? Should Andy have won that year? (To me just the balls alone to get that wave with 30 seconds left is cooler than whatever Andy did, plus he barely fell, he was almost on top of the board and if he had pulled it off compeltley I think it would be obvious he should've won)",surfing
1696968846.0,Tecate Police Shenanigans,"tl;dr --- coming home from a Baja surf trip, surfboards on the roof, we were targeted by Mexican police and prevented from progressing to the US border unless we paid a $200 fee for a ""traffic infraction."" 

After a really nice surf / camp trip, yesterday my friend, son and I were in the border line to head back into the states at Tecate. After about an hour in the line, we got to the point where the single line splits into two. We chose the right lane, but noticed too late that several vehicles ahead of us were trying to get out of the right lane we were in, and merge into the left lane. This was causing the right line to stop. After waiting about 10 minutes at a dead stop, my buddy got out of the car and walked up to the US CBP agent at the gate. He asked the agent if the right gate was open, and the agent said yes, but that the Mexicans had placed a barricade blocking movement in that lane. My buddy looked, and sure enough a barricade had been placed at the font of the line for that US entry gate. The US agent said although the gate was open, he could not do anything about the barricade as it was in Mexican territory.

When my buddy got back to our car, he said we'd need to get into the left lane because the right lane had been barricaded by what seemed like some homeless guy wearing a reflective consruction vest. But as we tried to merge into the left lane (thank you sweet lady for letting us merge), two Mexican motocycle cops rode up, and one of them parked in front of our car. I asked him what's up and he said we'd need to merge into the left lane, but that we would then have to exit that lane back into Tecate and drive to the back of line. He acted as if we had taken cuts (which I know is a big no no at Tecate). But this was not the case. There were dozens of cars in the right lane, all there after having been in the single lane for nearly an hour. The US gate for that lane was open, but that random dude had moved a barricade to block progress. The second cop then blocked all left lane traffic, causing a gap, and motioned us to drive into that lane then exit back into Tecate. I asked him why we couldn't just proceed to the US border in the left lane, and he said if we did it would be an infraction.

I really didn't want to drive back to the end of the line and wait for another hour, so I asked him how much the ""ticket"" for the ""infraction"" would be. He smiled and said, ""200 dollars."" I offered him $40. He laughed and motioned for us to exit the line back into Tecate proper. I didn't want to pay any more that $40 for this kind of bullshit, and not wanting to risk being fucked with again, we decided to exit the Tecate line and drive to Otay, where we crossed without issues in about 30 minutes.

As a former beach lifeguard for 5 years and current Emergency Trauma nurse for 2 years, I feel confident in saying that your fear of sharks is over blown.

A quick Google search on shark attack statistics will show you that in 2022 there were 52 shark attacks worldwide.... Not deaths, just bites, for the entire glode in a year (of those 52 some probably died, but the point still stands. The number is very small.)

There are over 7 billion people on the planet, the majority live near the coast. A large percentage of those enter the coastal waters with some regularity. Even if the reported number is only accounting for more developed nations, that's still a pool of at least 1 billion entering their waters annually as a reasonable estimate. 

52 out of 1 billion is infinitesimal.

The board is a pretty chunky shape with big round rails. I never really had an issue with sliding out before but the waves are usually a lot weaker, I feel like the extra speed combined with the rail shape may have caused the slide but I'm not totally sure.

My understanding is that a full rail is more forgiving/stable, so maybe it's just bad technique? Would a board with a harder rail help with bottom turns on the cleaner and more powerful waves?

writing this up in case it helps someone else since I struggled to get a sense of the place. So I just got home from a family trip (spouse, two kids ages 8&10) to Japan. We spent 4 days of the trip in Okinawa to relax, and enjoy the beach. I planned to spend one or two of the mornings in the water like I always do when family trips take me to surf destinations (bali, El Salvador, nicaragua, Mexico, Hawaii‚Ä¶): just find a shop, rent a board, ask where to surf and figure it out. 

This did not work. I was only on the main island with no time or plan to get a boat to good waves, and even with the typhoon off taiwan pushing swell, I got pretty skunked.

Difficulties: most of the known and ok for tourists waves are pretty fickle, from what people told me. Wind and swell direction matter a ton.
They‚Äôre also mainly high-tide only (so 2 hrs on either side) breaks because if shallow reef. 
There are two, maybe three places to ‚Äúrent boards‚Äù from what I could tell online, but all were closed Wednesday, so that was out. 

I ended up getting help from Danny of Happy Surfing Okinawa. (Google or IG). He runs a beginners surf camp and can send his partner to take better surfers hunting for decent waves in the van. (I didn‚Äôt do this because I was crunched for time, but everywhere was blown out so that crew ended up at the beginner spot anyway).

1696755131.0,What's your best rogue wave tale?,"I recently learned a bit about the history and science of rogue waves which got me thinking about those giant clean up sets that come out of the blue. What's a rogue wave/set that sticks out in your memory?

Mine was at Dreamland, Bali around 2016. At the time I was pretty inexperienced in anything overhead and it was mostly overhead sets. I paddled out through the channel and sat at the right as that's where most of the crowd was that day but I got intimidated by the size of the sets and the crowd so decided to paddle across the channel to the left which was where I usually surfed and there was hardly anyone out there. Caught a smaller set wave and paddled back out and was feeling pretty good. Then all of a sudden the horizon just started to lift up like it was being pushed up from below by some massive unseen force and it just kept on rising up until it had formed a grotesquely perfect looking turquoise wall of terror.

Usually when you get caught out by a sneaker set you react quickly and take action, but I was just stuck in a suspended animation state of pure disbelief. This couldn't possibly be happening. The wave was so unfathomably large to me it might as well have been the sky scraper high wave from Deep Impact. I just sat there immobilized by terror as it broke about 30 feet in front of me creating a mountain of rapidly approaching whitewater.

I'm not sure why I didn't just bail my board but as I went to duck dive I instinctually turned sideways at the last moment like you would if you were about to get hit front on by a bus. The board was violently ripped from my hands immediately and I got the worst spin cycle tumbling of my life. When I came up I had just enough time to get a breath in before the next wall of whitewater hit. My board got creased and I was pretty spooked for a while afterwards but otherwise unscathed. When I was sitting on the beach afterwards trying to process what happened an Aussie guy came back in and as he sat back down with his mates I overheard him saying ""Mate! What about that set!"".",surfing

1696810116.0,Possible Torn Hip Labrum. MRI Clear. Very Painful. Been Months. Please Help!,"Hello,

I believe I torn my right hip labrum around February/March of this year. I probably didn't really figure this out until around July.

The only thing I can really remember is that I bought a new bike that was kind of like a BMX bike, barely did anything with it however, the cadence was extremely off. I also worked a lot out in the GYM and used the Elliptical. I do remember riding the Elliptical one time and pain kicked in around 20 min around the back of my right SI joint. I pushed through the pain for another 10 min because it wasn't that bad. Also, we did move around the March/April time frame, it was a light move but a move none the less. Actually, considering it was probably a pretty heavy move. Then lastly, the only thing I think I may have did was stretch it out too much with weights. I remember feeling like my right leg needed some stretching so I put a weight on it while sitting Indian style. Nothing crazy, just like a 5 LB or 10 LB in order to push it a little while holding it.

Not sure if any of this torn my labrum or not but fast forward to July. My right hip was hurting so bad to include my right SI joint that I went to a Back Doctor and a Hip Doctor. The Back Doctor was decent however, the Hip Doctor PA was extremely rude. I ended up getting an MRI on my Back and my Right Hip after taking regular X-Rays per the Back Doctor. Both MRI's are clear except for the right Hip does have a Minor Impingement from I believe a small bone spur that is digging into my Femur Ball that is trying to heal itself creating a Fluid Nodule over and over again.

No one really gave me any answers I think because they didn't know what to do. My MRI's came back clean with no visual tear and the hip doctor people blew me off. Fast forward a few weeks and again the hip pain was so intense I went to a different Urgent Care that is Orthopedics only.  I met an Angel there. A PA that looked at everything I had. My X-Ray's, MRI's, listen to my story, etc. They said they knew exactly what I had. A damaged internal hip because of a bone spur. They have a special MD that they refer this to and they perform this Surgery 24/7.

Hip Arthroscopy Surgery

I was re-leaved to have some kind of answers because no one else did. I went to go see this MD and they gave me a Steroid Cortisone Shot. It did help and the pain mostly subsided. I would say for about six weeks on the dot. Then I figure I would test it out and go for a walk and boy it came back hard core. I would say the pain when it is really pissed off is about an 8/9. Completely debilitating.  I went for a 30 min walk and afterwards I would have to lay down on the opposite side and ice my hip for 30 min to be able to even stand again.

Things I can no longer do:

\-Walk longer than 5 min

\-Run

\-Mow the Yard

\-Go on any day trip and walk around

So I went back to my MD and told them everything. They are 100% convinced this is a Texted Book case of a Labrum Tear and they have offered to preform the Surgery. This Doctor has done it 2000+ times and has Good Ratings. I have all the information and they are literally just waiting on my phone call to schedule the Surgery.

Preset Day

So naturally, I started researching this on the internet and low and behold THIS is a MASSIVE topic on the internet. Tons and Tons of people video logging it and talking about. Strangely, though doesn't seem like there is any FRESH information on this though. Everything is around 3+, 5+, or even 10+ years old. Does this mean that everyone currently having this problem is just getting the surgery and moving on. Not really talking about it anymore? Have the Doctors mastered this procedure now?

My findings were that you could have a really great surgery, be a lot better off than you were before however, you many never be 100%. Meaning have realistic expectations of what you are going to get out of Surgery. I am leaning towards this because I believe this is a lot better chance of at least being able to walk again. I mean I would rather have the option to walk again than not have the option. Meaning if the Surgery is not the best outcome, well I at least tried. I mean I can't walk right now.

However, I have also heard a lot of people try to not get the Surgery. They do admit they have sacrificed a lot and can no longer run or do activities but they manage their every day lives I believe getting by the best they can. I am not sure I like this option.

Then you have a couple of miracle stories to where some people say they have heal their labrum even though all evidence says that you cannot. I think one person said it took like 10 years. Seriously?

I am not sure I have the stamina or the capability to do this. I do want to try to the best of my ability.

Enter in.

PT - Physical Therapy

I have been in PT for 3 weeks now. I felt a little better, so much so I worked out at home my own way. Big Mistake. Completely took a few steps back with major pain. (I did a minor ab routine) I will not do that again. However, to me the pain is so great I want to say yes to surgery and get this over with. However, my mind is saying have you really gave PT everything you got first? Could you be one of those 20% people to heal themselves out of this without surgery?

Am I a big baby? I mean maybe people deal with much worse pain levels and even run through this kind of pain. Seriously? No Way. How?

Should I somehow become a super hero and fight though this pain and PT and beat this on my own somehow?

Here is my current thought process.

Try PT for another 4-6 weeks. If I make significant process. Delay Surgery.

I don't think I can make it and within 2-3 weeks out I am going to cave and schedule the surgery.

Pain Levels

1-2 - Almost constant throughout the day (Sometimes NASID Sometimes Not)

4-6 - Mid Day, office work around the job or house (bad days) (NASID)

7-8 - Mow the Yard, 15+ min walk, Day Trip (need immediate rest and ice, hot bath, NASID)

Help!

So please, what would you do? What have you done? What is the latest information regarding this? I just don't want to get the Surgery and find out that the Labrum Tear wasn't the actually problem. I mean sometimes I feel its a hurt ligament or other things like what is listed below:

\-Sacrotuberious Ligament issue

\-SI Joint issue

\-Pulled Groin

\-Anything else in the Pelvic Region?

\-IT Band

Side note, all blood work is clear, X-Ray's are clear, MRI's are clear. However, I know this Pain is real and not in my Head. I mean in either case they can clean up the bone spur, look around with the scope and fix any problems they find if I do the surgery. Thus far, I am leaning towards Surgery and maybe think I have 3-6 weeks of PT left in my mind in order for a Miracle to happen before I call and schedule the surgery.

I am just so tired of literally doing nothing except rest, ice and laying around. I know it will hurt if I do anything. I am doing PT 3 days a week, but is that enough? I am hoping I can get those few steps that I went back to a baseline of at least not hurting doing nothing.

I mean I could possibly do something if I ice that area, stack up on NASID's and do something minor but I will probably pay for it later.

You arrive to your freshly cleaned and waxed board, use the changing rooms, walk straight out the door over to the waves, surf, come back, leave your wet sandy stuff, shower, put your comfy clothes back on, drive home. And chill.


No taking your surfboard on/off the car, no changing out of your wetsuit in a parking lot or on the sand, getting your wet feet all sandy and then putting on socks (horrifying). No surfboard taking up 25% of the space in your home or Appartment.

Wanna start with one, then have multiple, each at the most popular surfing spots in San Diego, and maybe someday around the world. Just gotta find the perfect real estate location so it's nothing but a short walk to the waves. Will be difficult, but I believe In the idea.


If successful, will also include things like board waxing/cleaning staff, key fobs, I'll make it have beachy/tiki hut vibes, maybe even a sauna or hot tub.

Me: Im 17, I‚Äôve been surfing for a few years and have moved to a 5‚Äô9 puddle jumper (~37 liters). I am 5‚Äô9 and 140 lbs and am decently athletic (I snowboard and skate very often and play tennis. I‚Äôm also a proficient wake surfer). I don‚Äôt usually have a problem catching waves, especially on more average/bigger days. I would also like to add, I surf in Oregon and wear a wetsuit surfing in cold water. Idk how much of an impact this really makes, but I‚Äôve heard ppl talk abt it. 

At this point I am working on progressing my top to bottom surfing and am looking for a board that I can ride in bigger and better waves, (on 4-5 foot days my puddle jumper feels bulky and the rail almost feels like it‚Äôs gonna skip out on steep drops. This is absolutely somewhat related to my level of surfing and it‚Äôs not fully the boards fault I‚Äôm sure, but it does feel like something with less volume could work well for me on those days?) 

I found a used 5‚Äô6 album twinsman (30 liters) for a great deal and am wondering if this board is going to feel like too drastic of a change, or if it‚Äôs going to progress my surfing in the way I want it to. Does anyone have experience with it and know if it makes a good daily driver for that average to good 4-7 foot range? my local surf shop recommended a pyzel phantom but new boards are expensive and i haven‚Äôt been able to find anything used.  

I want a board that is above my skill level so I can grow with it (I am also young and surfboards are not something I can find money for often). The board seems like it could be a great fit, I‚Äôd really appreciate any thoughts, or feel free to gaslight me into spending money if you hate the way these posts saturate the r/surfing feed. 

Tldr; album twinsman for first higher performance board, coming from grovelor. Also is 5‚Äô6 too low volume for 5‚Äô9 and 140lbs?

Weeks went by. Expected delivery date passed. I gave it more time, and eventually called him. He told me he was behind due to workload, but that It would be soon. 

I finally got the call that my new board was ready, and I went to his shaping studio to pick it up. There were a couple other people there waiting to meet with the shaper, a couple of friends of his that were just hanging out, and his assistant. When he saw me enter, he looked up and smiled, excused himself from a conversation, and showed me to the board. There it lay, beautifully glistening beneath the lights. I walked over to it, and everyone in the room oohed and ahhed, commenting on its beauty.

I picked it up, held it above me to examine it and appreciate its beauty, when for some goddamn reason it slipped from my hands and fell right onto its tail, hitting the concrete floor with a sickening crack.

The room fell silent. I looked at the shaper. He looked at me with an expression that I can only describe as infinite disappointment and awe. I placed the board down onto a pair of saw horses and examined the tail. Cracked right through to the foam.

An otherwordly voice broke the silence. One of the guys in the room said loudly and with a laugh, ""Well, now that you got that out of the way go out and rip.""

(1) 6'0 modern fish with twins. High wave count, fast carving rides, but 30% I feel like I dont have enough fin to hold when it barrels(2) 6'0 Dominator setup with thrusters. Medium wave count and I obviously turn easier and faster than the twin fish. When I do catch, 50% of the rides are good and 50% I get bucked off because the tail section feels too wide. Maybe this board isnt ideal for a wave this big. Or maybe I just need more practice on it?(3) 6'8 custom shaped, very narrow, 19"" wide with pulled in nose. Lower wave count but when it catches, I have far more control. It looks and feels like it was designed for a bigger wave so maybe this Im on the right track with this one.

(4) 8'2"" custom shaped swallow tail with quads. Down rails with chine, high rocker, heavily foiled. Wave count is very high, but the length and fin config prevent it from turning fast. More importantly, I'd rather improve my shorter-board skills, so scratch this one out.

I see boards like the Firewire Houdini, but these conditions are rare, so it seems silly to buy another board just for this wave type. Perhaps I should think about spreading my quiver out a bit. For example, have two 6'0 shortboards, one as a daily-driver and one higher-performance specs",surfing

These pillow waves are soft and plump

Fat high tide slack and slump

With little peak but

Still somewhat

A chance for a sleepy swoop or pump

These porridge waves are a bit of mush

Kinda lully with little push

Spoiled by the rising

Not surprising

But hoping for my own Blue Crush

Wishes finally supplied

Horizon heaving

Eyes disbelieving

My crush is squeezing me inside

A pugnacious pugilistic mound

My body battered

Wits are scattered

But I think I‚Äôll go another round

Neoprene me straight back to shore

Cheeks red glowing

A shameful showing

For tourists, locs, and kooks galore

With cocktail waves turned barroom brawl

Still a bit of thirst

But first

I think I hear a burrito call.

1696226660.0,Who has terrible eyesight? What's your experience?,"I surf alone 98% of the time. My eyesight is also really terrible, like I can't see something clearly 6 feet from my face. 
Surfing is the only thing other than sleep that i still do without glasses/ contacts. 

I wear my glasses down to the beach and choose where I'm going to paddle out and sit because when i take off my glasses my vision of the ocean just turns into an incoherent mess. Like I've gone down to check it without glasses and been like wow there's no one out and my mates will be like wtf dude, there's like 30 people out. 
Even when there are lots of other people in the water i rarely have an interaction with someone because i just can't see their face. I can just see a blurry blob. Over time I've basically just learnt to completely ignore people. Might sound like a jerk move but after years of saying hi to people only to realise they weren't even looking at me, or responding to someone only to realise they are looking past me talking to someone else, you just get sick of having awkward interactions.
For example, a couple months ago I was surfing a small point break with my partner, she is still learning. We were sitting behind the pack just taking small leftovers, i rode one in. As i was paddling back out I saw her paddleing out into the crowd. I whistled, got her attention and waved for her to paddle back to me. I didn't know why she decided to head out to the peak but she definitely wasn't at the level yet. Anyway, she hesitated to paddle back to me but she finally did and as she got near me i realised my terrible mistake. It wasn't my partner. It was a local Japanese man, different gender, different coloured board, different in every way except they were both wearing a hat and i couldn't tell the difference. I actually whistled at one of the locals and waved them into me. 
We had a good laugh but it was super embarrassing. 

Waves also come in blurry blobs but I've learnt to read the ocean well based on rises and falls on the horizon and changes in colour.

I actually really struggle to enjoy myself when I'm surfing with other people or interacting with them. 

Part of me really wants to start surfing with contacts, but it's already an expensive hobby and i worry about eye infections. Part of me wants to get some prescription surf goggles and turn into like a sort of kooky superhero.

But then there's also a part of me that appreciates the unknown. I love being able to zone out of everything and just be in my own little world. I was seriously anxious about surfing by myself for years, i always wanted to paddle out with a friend so i had a reference point for where i was but I'd usually lose them after one wave anyway and spend the session by myself. 

Now that I'm really comfortable reading the ocean from instinct and feel, I'm hesitant to get my vision back. But it does make surfing unfamiliar spots and rock walks/jumps difficult. 

I know that if i use vision i will never go back to not wearing my glasses. The same thing happened with skating. I couldn't skate wearing glasses for ages because it would throw my depth perception way off. But as soon as i got used  to it i stopped being able to skate without them. 

I actually used contacts for a surf a few years ago. I did it once and it was mind blowing, the clarity was out if this world. But at the time I didn't have more and i couldn't afford to keep buying them. I also lost one in that session.
 
I would love to hear people's experiences. 

Those who use contacts, do you use dailys and a new pair every session? Do you wear monthlys and just chuck them in the dishwasher? Do you still surf if you don't have contacts or if you lose one in the surf does that end the session? 

Does anyone wear prescription glasses/goggles?",surfing

Started surfing almost 20 years ago but had to take the past 5 years off after a nasty motorcycle accident messed up my shoulder pretty good.

Back into the swing of things this spring and no problems with cruisy cutbacks, but want to work back towards ""top to bottom"" surfing like I could (albeit not well) before my injury. 

My current ""daily driver"" is a 7'2 (50L) Chilli Mid Strength. It's been a stellar board but a lot to swing around. Also been on a 6'4 Rawson Alien (43L) a lot this summer - fast, very very flat, lots of paddle power, but in anything above chest high if I'm not getting in on the shoulder I've been getting hung up by the lack of nose rocker (burying the nose when trying to get on rail before hitting the flats). Before my injury my bigger day board was a 6'6 CI Black Beauty (35L) which I still have but haven't touched in many years. 

I'm hoping the Pyzalien2 XL in either a 6'0 (34L) or 6'2 (38L) would slot in somewhere well, fast with a good amount of paddle power but more rocker to handle a bit more size and be more maneuverable to progress on as I get back into the sport. 

Countering all this, I am far from surfing any of my boards to their full potential and beyond what I perceive to be a nose rocker issue with the Alien I'm sure I'm not being held back by my equipment at all.",surfing

I currently surf an epoxy 5 7 (30.8 lt) gofish shaped from a local shaper which has helped my surfing a ton. I really like the speed down the line, the flow, and when I find it's sweet spot (2 - 4 ft) it really handles well. However, I think when it gets over over 5 feet it starts to struggle; I feel (maybe because of shape / because its epoxy) it starts lifting up, and in general, its limiting my progression (want to do a little more sharp turns).

I felt it struggled in this size of wave (6-7ft imo)

https://preview.redd.it/rmwiqh2ho8rb1.jpg?width=3456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5d38f820651bc284e335eb51987f946137a7857

Two weeks ago, I got a 5 6 (27. 7lt) ci twin pin shaped from a another local shaper (different from the first) for bigger waves (6ft) . Unfortuneatly, it didn't perform as I wanted (felt too small, didnt float nice, and paddling in for big waves was hard). I don't if I asked for dimensions too small for me (dimensions from william allioti video) or maybe the materials weren't as solid. I ended up dinging the bottom and ripping one of its fin box in a wipeout on my 4th session.

Because of this, I'm looking to shape a new more permformancy daily driver with the first shaper. Something that has a good paddle, flow down the line, lay backs and some vertical surf. Soemthing that can habdle bigger days, but also work in medium surf (3 - 8 ft). Im thinking of the cc lanesplitter or maybe album twinsman/light bender. Anyone have any experience with any of those boards or could recommed a shape I should try? People who owned seaside/gofish, what board would you recommend? Please take into account that this board will be made in epoxy.

**Litreage question:**

How much lt do you think I could cut for new daily driver. I feel like the 27.7 i ordered the twin pin was too litte, but I'm also skeptical that the material/product wasn't as solid. I'm thinking of around a 5 6 lane spitter with 28.4 lt, but I'm afraid I might be ordering too small again.

Except this fucker will not come out. 


This is one of those old ass boxes that doesn't have a little ramp near the vertical slot to turn the plate up into. So I thought, I'll just jam it all the way forward, out of the way, and stick my extra hardware in there. Well, that won't go in either. Tried taking a razor blade to the corners of the vertical channel so the plate could rotate in, but I can't cut this plastic. This is some pre-EPA DuPont magic plastic. It's like solid, injected molded Teflon. 


Any ideas? I'm hesitant to start drilling out my fins since I want to swap a few fins in and see what works best, and don't want to have those holes then be too big to put back in other boards. For once swaylocks doesn't have the magic answer, nor does jamboards.",surfing

1695674563.0,"UPDATE: ""I feel undergunned""... (funny surf story from this weeks hurricane swell).","Thought y'all might enjoy this. A few weeks back I made a post about feeling undergunned. Well, Hurricane Nigel swell hit Cornwall yesterday - and my dumbass thought it was a great idea to take out the 5'7 Psycho Nitro in legit 8-10ft Fistral (8 feet 15 seconds) - with a howling 30 mph offshore.

Jumped off the rocks and realized this was serious. Everyone was on 7-foot guns, and I was severely mistaken. Tried to paddle into a few bombs (I'm fairly familiar with how the waves work at Fiz, so didn't end up getting caught out at all as the period was so high you could time the sets fine).

After a while, decided all was hopeless and began the mission to paddle in. Fistral, like many other deep water beach breaks - is mushy on the big bombs, and absolutely detonates on the inside. So I hatched my plan. Wait for the massive set (sets were only 2 waves thankfully, every \~15 mins), then gun it and take one on the head and in.

So - after the next set, I get my head down and gun it to the shore. It's a solid 300 feet to paddle in, with nuts currents but I just know as long as I take a 6 footer on the head, it'll be fine. 

Just my luck - a freak set hits as soon as I'm in the middle of the impact zone. Turn around, gun it try and get under them. First one is a medium 6 footer - thankfully just get under it.

The second one - I was not so lucky. This freak of satan, dredging, evil, lurching 10 footer was baring it's teeth directly on me. You know when you just know, instantly that you're fucked? Like you don't even bother? I distinctly remembered laughing outloud and exclaiming this is where I die.

Unlike every single massive set wave - this one broke top to bottom, full barrel. I make the business decision that against 99% of Reddit's advice, I'm ditching my board and swimming under on this one.

I distinctly remember seeing the lip launching down on me as I sink under, and just mentally preparing for the beating of a lifetime. Bear in mind - I haven't even been surfing 2 years yet. And that's not 2 years Hawaii - that's 2 years in the UK. We don't get hurricanes. So as I'm underwater - I'm pretty sure I'm about to be eating my own feet.

I feel the initial impact like a truck to my back, but somehow - I didn't get sucked back over and detonated. My leash didn't snap either. I got that super lucky trick where you get sucked back and spat out the back. 

Genuinely surprised I was alive - I went to grab my board. Got it underneath me, and adrenaline was pumping so hard I went to paddle for the smaller 5 foot wave to get to the shore - as I pressed down on the board to get in, it folded in my hands. That last wave had landed directly on the stringer and decimated it. I cant imagine what taking the direct impact of that wave on my head would have felt like.

Thankfully - I body boarded the next white water in, and was out for another day. Borrowing a friends 6 foot shortboard now (yay for adequate board length).

I've now decided I have to actually take big(ger) wave surfing as something serious - and get the bloody equipment for it. Everyone was out on a 7 foot gun, don't take a fucking toothpick out in serious surf. Respect the dang ocean. I think it's kinda easy to gaslight yourself into still being a beginner surfer - so you don't need ""serious"" board. But the only way you're gonna get that experience when you're ready is to give it a shot. This power and size is \*right\* on the edge of my comfort zone. I'd have been shitting it - but I could have swam in had my leash broke, and the sets were very very lully. Had it have been any bigger, and any less mushy on the sets - no way would I have gone.

But yes. Lesson learned. Try not to send it too hard, folks. Great story tho - and I did quite enjoy the walk up the beach with a folded board as onlookers look at you like you've just 1v1'd tyson fury.",surfing

Has anyone used this product to alleviate shoulder pain? If so what is your experience? I have torn labrums in both shoulders (type 2 slap on right, minor on left) with some posterior cartilage damage.

I come from a climbing background and I'm built like an upside down triangle: wide shoulders, smaller chest, even smaller waist. I've tried 4 wetsuits and feel insane.

# Measurements

* **Height**: 5'7""
* **Weight:** 150lbs
* **Waist** (at widest part near belly button when sitting down): 33"" .. 31.5"" standing up normally.
* **Chest** (at widest part - middle of pec): 41.5""
* **Shoulders** ([straight across back of neck](https://tailor.fandom.com/wiki/Shoulder_Width_(measurement)) \- end points are middle of shoulder): 22""
   * deltoids literally stick out sideways, adding to this measurement in practice

I've tried 2 O'Neill wetsuits and a couple of no-name ones from Amazon. Here's their size chart: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V7D9N1F?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details&th=1&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V7D9N1F?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1&psc=1)

The most recent and best fitting wetsuit I tried was a ""large-short"" O'Neill Epic. The legs, crotch, waist, and lower chest fit **perfectly.** Once I tried zipping up the neck it was like I was wearing a corset. Restricted breathing and movement.

I'm worried the next size up (XL short) is going to be baggy around the waist because its lowest measurement (35"") is 2"" wider than my actual waist. An XL might be very long too, considering I'm only 5'7.

1695420876.0,Help me pick a Twin Fin Set-Up,"So I am getting a new custom fish and I am looking at different fin options for weak mushy beach break waves.  In the winter we can get some nice waves, but we also get a lot of wind slop.  This is going to be my all around board.  It is a 6‚Äô4 big guy fish - I am 200 lb and almost died from COVID.  I was in a coma on a vent for 2 months and supposed to have a lung transplant.  I still have some lung scarring so a little extra float is unfortunately needed until I lose some weight and hopefully build my lungs back.  If I get back into shape it will be a great grovel board or a fantastic point break board.  The break is a little point breakish as it wraps around the jetty on a decent swell.

I have surfed for 30 years and can carve well and I have always been a powerful surfer so I am leaning towards a larger fin.  In my old fish I had some Mark Richards style fins (before FCS marketed the MR fins) with a small glasses in nubster style trailer.  It was more of a performance style fish that I had custom made in 2001 before we had so many fin options.  The board was like magic, but it is just to small for me at this point.  The new board will be a larger version of my old high performance style fish.

The fins I am looking at are the Britt Merrick Twin Fin, Mick Fanning Twin Fin, MR Free Ride, MR twin Fin and the Machado Keel.  I want something that will help beat out section and give me a little extra lift and drive while still allowing for vertical surfing.  Right now the BMT, MF and Free Ride seem like the best choices.  I would love to hear other people‚Äôs experiences.",surfing

I gotta say, it's really intimidating to roll up to a break to hop in for a session. I thought I'd get a sunset session in last night, at a spot that I had been to a couple times, at low tide. This time was high tide and while getting in was easy, getting out looked like it could be kooked pretty hard. I stood with my wettie on, board in hand, and watched. Conditions looked pretty good, head high at a perfect right hand point/reef setup, slightly choppy, nothing I can't handle. I watched a couple guys battle the rip for easily 20 minutes while waiting for a wave to bring them to the little patch of sand among rocks. Another guy timed the regular spot perfectly and hopped out no worries. Light was fading and I just decided to no-go. I likely would have been fine but I really don't want to be the guy to do something dumb. I guess more paddle fitness would give me more confidence, and more open water swimming practice, 'cause that shit is difficult. I can swim a kilometer in a pool without too much difficulty but swimming in the ocean is way harder! My home break is boat access and cold af so I don't get practice swimming in beach break or navigating rocky ins and outs. I've been kinda down on myself about not hopping in but the spot is known for being pretty challenging. I'm used to being able to push myself really hard at alpine climbing and ski mountaineering but man, surfing is so humbling. I'm trying not to suck at it, and sometimes I feel like I don't, but then it makes me set my cup down like nothing else. I guess that's what makes it so rewarding. Thanks for attending my Ted talk.

TLDR;

Do's:

1. Listen to lifeguards
2. Be Respectful to the regulars/locals - Be nice
3. Bring the right equipment - everyone is surfing to progress and have fun - be prepared - wear a leash.
4. Know what the swell is doing. (one minute the swell can suck, but an hour later it can be overhead - know the forecast)
5. Stretching and warming up - from a 29 y.o. talking about preventing injuries
6. Know your limits - ""if in doubt, don't go out""
7. take a lesson - show aloha to north shore coaches like in Haleiwa
8. Time your paddle out - when to paddle out ""very tricky to master...everyone I know professional surfers still get smoked...burn so much more energy than you needed to.""
9. Take turns with the people your surfing with - if you just caught a wave, let someone else go
10. Please clean up your trash - ""We as surfers need to conscious of how we treat the beach""

Don'ts

1.  Don't paddle into a surfers way when they are on a wave - ""the most frustrating thing as a surfer...I would rather take a whole set on the head to stay out of someone's way""
2. Don't paddle out around everyone and try to get a wave - don't paddle out into a group and take the first wave that comes in
3. Don't Surf Pipeline - you will be competing the the best surfers in the world who will be having a bad day
4. Don't snake anyone on a wave - paddle around someone to get deeper to call them off. ""you don't do it"" 
5. Don't drop in on people - ""you can put someone in harm's way...especially in the North Shore you could hurt someone or hurt yourself...and you could get beat up for it.""
6. Don't paddle for a wave and pull back - ""if you paddle for a wave and you don't go, to me in my mind, that's an automatic, ok this guys not going to go on any waves, he is not serious about catching waves...don't even paddle for a wave if you're not serious about going.""
7. Don't Panic - ""it is very easy to start panicking...relax, stay calm, get some breaths in.""
8. Don't drive fast on the back roads -Especially on Ke Nui Road on the North Shore since it is a residential street with families and kids that live there.",surfing

Do you feel the liquid seams restrict movement compared to GBS w/ tape? I wonder if it just makes me work harder and not provide that much extra insulation.

We already know we can steal your car/truck/van if its under the wheel or in your 'trailer hitch safe'. 

Solution:  Almost all car manufacturers have an 'emergency' key that comes out of your FOB by pushing a little button. You bring THAT key with you in your trunks (usually have a handy string to loop around it so you don't lose it) or your wetsuit key pocket. 

Google '**how to remove emergency key for (YEAR MODEL MAKE) FOB**' and you will learn how to get your little key out. 

How to lock my doors if the FOB is in the car? Your manufacturer knows this needs to happen. You take the emergency key with you and leave the FOB in the car.

Lock all the non driver doors manually then lock the driver door with your little emergency key and you are all set!

No more losing your keys up your prison purse for the Dr. to retrieve or losing them all in the sand or watching the local homeless guy driving away in your windowless ~~molester~~ van.

there are times where i've kept low all the way to the lip and the expanded and kept speed through the top turn but i'm still mostly just speeding / pumping up and down.

More detail: earlier this year I was riding boards around 28L but have recently dropped liters and feeling more maneuverability. I buy 2nd hand boards as I seem to progress to smaller boards every few months. My current favorite is a [Dalton Jett](https://lostsurfboards.co.nz/fun-boards) (5'7 x 19 x 2.2 and 25.8L) twin plus trailer that felt great from the first wave. It seems to work well in the often soft beach breaks of Mount Maunganui (New Zealand)  but also felt great at the point break in Raglan on a head high day. With this board I am catching waves easily and it feels very stable for pop up. It's fast and locks into the face when needed, like taking a deep drop and getting down the line. But it's also easy to turn when I want to. I'm still developing my cutbacks and hacks and feel like this board will allow me to work on those with confidence.

I've been frequently riding twins (sometimes with trailer, sometimes not) the last 1.5 years but I'm wondering if a thruster would help my progression more, maybe more predictable through turns? With twins I sometimes don't know how hard to drive with the back foot, catching a rail if I push too hard. So I've had my eye out for thrusters and recently found an Inferno 72 (5'9 x 18 3/4 x 2 3/8 and 26.4L). I haven't quite gelled with this board. It feels a bit shaky when popping up, I expect because it is the narrowest board I've ridden. I could probably get used to this though it also feels difficult to turn once on my feet. Maybe this is bad technique. But with the Jett responding like I want, I wonder if the Inferno is too long or too big for me. Perhaps a 5'7 or 5'8 in this model would be better.

The Jett is working great so I'm thrilled to have that. It's meant for 1-5ft waves and does seem to excel in that size and can go if it's soft. I'd love to find a thruster to experiment with on bigger/hollower waves in the 2-8ft range. Should I be looking more at 24 liters for my weight?

I'd love some thoughts on twins vs thrusters for progression and when is the right time to drop liters.",surfing

1695094220.0,Adult learner shortboard diary entry 0,"Tactical Brain-dump incoming...

31m 5'8 135lbs surfing 7'6 egg for 2 and a bit years, picked up a 6' Chilli rare bird hybrid shortboard at 32.5L and here's how it went.

&#x200B;

* Session 0 - fun but crowded 1-2ft conditions at local beach break. My aim was to become vaguely familiar with lying on and paddling on the board, I noticed just how specific the sweet spot for paddling is, having my chest a few cm either direction had the nose either sticking way up or bogging underwater.

&#x200B;

* Session 1 - Glassy 2-3ft at remote beach break. During this session I caught some really fun waves, the stand out was a wave where I kept a high line and powered along, noting that applying some pressure on my rear foot really acted like an accelerator in comparison to my 7'6 which feels a bit more steady. Surfed for 3 hours and my arms were really burning and weak toward the end of the session, it's been a long time since I really felt like that because my bigger board paddles easier.

&#x200B;

* Session 2 - Very low period 3-4ft messy waves with a large amount of refraction and warping on the surface. This session was a brutal wake up call for me because I struggled to maintain a good paddling position due to the unstable water surface. Also, the frequent walls of white water had me quite gassed from having to duckdive often, I think my technique is currently inefficient.

&#x200B;

* Session 3 (Today) - Again, very messy low period but bigger, maybe 4-5ft. It was a mistake to take  shortboard out, I knew the swell was building but I didn't anticipate it being as big as it was. A positive thing is that I had less trouble maintaining a good paddling position this time, and I had some effective duckdives under the larger waves which really felt amazing in comparison to doing turtle rolls on my 7'6.

A huge mistake I made during today's session is that once I made it out back, I immediately went for a wave instead of waiting to fully catch my breath, I was way over eager and I paid dearly for it; I was too deep and went over the falls and took a couple wave hold down, which ignited a small amount of panic in me, as I was already a bit out of breath. I called it after that and after noticing how far I'd drifted sideways along the beach.

Other things I've learnt so far..

* I'm not riding the wave much differently to how I would on my 7'6, aside from slightly sharper cutbacks. This possibly means I'm not at the required skill level to be on a shortboard yet, I'm not going as top to bottom as the board could potentially go, and I'm still not sure if the shortboard will help me learn to surf in a more vertical style.
* I did sacrifice some time spent actually riding waves so far, due to misjudging the amount of paddling required or being too far from the peak, where my 7'6 would normally catch waves easily.
* The extra amount of exertion required on the shortboard threw off my ability to calculate my comfort zone, the waves today were NOT bigger than I'm comfortable with, but my tiredness made the hold downs more scary.
* Shortboards are very fun!

1695100102.0,First time in San Jose del Cabo,"I‚Äôm going to Los Cabos for the first time and am just now realizing that the hotel I booked (amazing deal, so not many options) is a bit far from where I want to surf (Old Man‚Äôs).  My original plan was just to Uber or bus to the beach, rent a board nearby each morning, return it after my session, then head back to the hotel, but now I‚Äôm wondering what to do with my belongings while I‚Äôm in the water. 

At home I feel comfortable leaving everything in a backpack on the beach, but it feels a bit sketchy in a new foreign location. Last time I went on a surf trip the beach was walking distance so I just left everything in the hotel and picked up my room key at the front desk when I got back. What do people usually do in this area? Is it safe to leave a backpack on the beach, are there lockers nearby, will the surf shop hold my stuff till I return?

Also, I just found out that a lot of areas are off limits for swimming, but does that include surfing too? Could I just rent a board and surf in front of my hotel?

What do you guys do when you‚Äôre there? I feel like an idiot for not realizing these things sooner. Please help.

Edit: if I rent a car, what do I do with the keys? I doubt it‚Äôll include a valet key and I can‚Äôt bring a fob into the water.

1694983720.0,"Surfed an unfamiliar, localized break for the first time, caught waves, and didn't get in any fights.","Listen up, kooks. I wrote this awhile back but hesitated to post it.  Maybe now is the right time, so here‚Äôs a counter-narrative to all the toxic tales of localism that tend to trend here (especially lately). This story is all true.  Every single word of it.

Earlier this year, I surfed a very localized break for the first time, and I didn't get in any fights.  No one swore at me.  No one burned me.  No one slashed my tires or waxed my windshield.  Not only that, but I got some great fucking waves on a day when it was shitty almost everywhere else for miles around.  How'd I pull off such a miracle?   And, more importantly, how can you?  Well, youngbloods, let me tell you a tale...

I pulled up to the spot and everyone's truck was bigger than my ride, and they all seemed to know each other.  And everyone looked me over when I rolled up.  I said 'hi' and 'good morning' and 'whassup' to *everyone* that looked my direction.

A couple of guys were already in the water, but half a dozen or so were standing around the overlook gauging the conditions.  I ambled over and took a seat next to the oldest guy in the group, gave him a nod, and *kept my mouth shut.*  We just watched the ocean together.  And one by one, guys toddled off to suit up until it was just me and the old man.

We talked surf, discussed the water, and agreed that the waves were better there than anywhere else along the coast that day.  As if to confirm our observations, some bigger OH sets came through and produced a clean, meaty wall. Somehow the swell seemed to focus on this one spot, and the same wind that made other spots blown out was blowing sweetly offshore.  As he talked, I listened and watched how guys made it out to the lineup, where they positioned, who was getting rides, and which set waves seemed to hold up best.

Then, I took my time suiting up and made my way down to the beach.  No hurry, no rush.  The old guy was already there, and after a few stretches, we paddled out together.  And for the next 30 minutes, I didn't paddle for shit.  I sat wide, and I watched.  I got my bearings in the water and made mental notes of who caught what, where.

Eventually, a set swung wide and I was in perfect position.  I turned to go, but a guy inside of me (closer to the beach but further from the peak) was paddling too.  He had already gotten several waves, and I was in the priority position.  So what did I do?  I fucking backed off and let him have it.

It was a sick wave, and he made good work of it.  I felt a tinge of jealousy and, despite my fear that my entire session might look like that, I complimented him anyway when he made it back out to the lineup.  And the next wave that came?  No one hassled me for it.  The lineup watched as I stroked in and caught my best wave of the year.  And from that point on, I was in the rotation.

About an hour later, I missed one of the best outside set waves of the session.  A couple of guys sitting further inside missed it too *because of me.*  They thought I was gonna get it, so they backed off.  As I hung my head, I heard one of them yell something towards me, and I immediately thought, ""Fuck, here it comes.""  I raised my hands and apologized for wasting it.  He yelled again, ""No, I said *damn, you almost had it.* Don't worry, you'll get the next one!""

But I didn't get the next one.  In fact, I let a few go through to the other guys that had been waiting.  And *then* I caught another to finish out a great session.

**TLDR** \- **went to a localized break for the first time, didn't act like an entitled ass or an anti-social goon, respected others, apologized when I fucked up, had the right board and abilities for the conditions, and ended up having a great session with no drama**

What kooks often fail to realize is that every break or region has a different culture, and that not every lineup shares the same culture as their home break.  I‚Äôm a pretty average surfer but I‚Äôve gotten waves at some localized breaks even when I look nothing like the locals or might not even speak the language.

In most cases, there‚Äôs no big secret trick.  Do your abilities match the spot?  Are you on suitable equipment for the wave?  After that, it just requires spending a little time observing the scene, trying to make a human connection to others, and showing some humility and respect.

And, especially when you‚Äôre traveling, this includes when you‚Äôre outside of the water too.  Because there‚Äôs a good chance that you‚Äôve already made an impression in the community before you even paddle out.  Kooks will act rude to their server or their driver, or harass the local women, or just act loud and obnoxious, and then be surprised when they paddle out the next morning and catch shit from the locals in the lineup.  

Moral of the story? Sure, sometimes it won't matter what you do because some assholes are undoubtedly gonna be assholes no matter what.  But if you don‚Äôt just bust on to the scene like a self-centered dickhead, you can *probably* avoid aggro in the water 99% of the time.  Of course, YMMV.  ",surfing

My question is was I in the wrong by chilling on the shoulder waiting my turn and then turning my board getting ready to go if they didn‚Äôt make it? I‚Äôve done that at plenty of other spots (Hawaii, Bali, Costa Rica, PNW) with no issue. Also I just wanted to vent

My general understanding is that if I pull all the fins back, it will give a little more hold and draw out turns, whereas further forward fins loosen the board up a bit.

The question is what if you moved the front fins up but pulled the rear fins back? Or vice versa? So you played with the separation between the quad set up itself? I don‚Äôt really have a solid enough understanding of water physics to grasp how that might potentially change the ride!

I am 6' tall, 190lbs, and have relatively weak paddle strength.  I'm a beginner, (I just recently started getting up and riding straight on a 6'6 Odysea Skipper, in 2-4' wave conditions), and I'm looking for a board to transition me to fish/shortboard lengths.

Between a 6', 6'2, 6'4 and 6'6, what size Booby Quad would serve me best as a One Board Quiver?  I have intentions of developing my skills further, so I'd like the board to have enough foam to allow me to get into waves easily while my paddle strength is still lacking, though I'd like there to be room for it to remain a fun board for me as I further my capabilities and experience.

Without any guidance, I'm leaning towards the 6'6 with 47L of buoyancy just because all of my experience to date has been with high volume foam boards.  Is there any downside to the larger/thicker board?  My main desire of purpose for this board is to be a daily rider and allow me to move from beginner to intermediate!

I recently had a harrowing experience that was, admittedly, due to my lack of experience. I attempted to reach the green waves in conditions that were nearing stormy. After some time, when I looked back, I found that I had been swept away by the current, placing me distressingly far from the shore. Panic quickly took over, especially as exhaustion set in and I doubted my ability to swim back. One thought did provide a glimmer of hope - the potential SOS signal on my watch. At one point, I even considered letting go of my surfboard, but thankfully decided against it.

Thankfully, I managed to get back to the shore on my own. After the incident, I wanted to familiarize myself with the SOS feature on my watch for future reference. To my surprise, my Garmin watch doesn't seem to have this capability.

  
This was a valuable learning experience for me. I'd like to ask the community: What should one do if caught in a similar situation in the future? What's the best strategy if you're being pulled further out to sea? Additionally, are there any reliable SOS devices designed for such situations that you would recommend?",surfing
1694705714.0,Multiple Shoulder dislocations (latarjet surgery),"What‚Äôs up friends! I have read through all the different posts about this topic and still felt the need to post. I want to start off saying I cannot express how much I appreciate the internet for things like this, and any comments are GREATLY appreciated :)

Since I was 15 (I am 26 now) I have had reoccurring dislocations with my left shoulder. Obviously as a kid I didn‚Äôt PT like I should have (I also wish someone would have forced me into surgery maybe?) but regardless I have once again ended up back in a position where I am afraid to move my body. 

For the past three months I‚Äôve diligently performed a program called ‚ÄúBullet Proof Shoulders‚Äù from an awesome dude named Trevor Hash. It has tons of animal movements and hanging exercises that had my shoulder feeling the best it‚Äôs ever been since the first dislocation. I unfortunately did a pec stretch incorrectly and boom there it went again.

I now am confident I want to try surgery even tho I will probably be paying it off for the rest of my life (but who cares if it fixes my problem?) I am insanely diligent with PT and very conscious about good posture and muscle recruitment. This injury has taught me so much, and if I can get my shoulder to the point of pushing through pain after surgery doing PT for a working shoulder I will fu$&ing do it 100000X over.

So please share your experience with latarjet surgery or anything similar. 

Thanks again :) -Zach",surfing
1694714970.0,Too fat? Too Slow? Positioing? Behind on Waves,"Trying to figure out what might be driving some of my recent NorCal ""performance issues.""  Been surfing a few times (2-3x) a week.  When waves get bigger and faster (say head high+), I find myself falling behind sections particularly after bottom turn.  I've noticed that on about half of my waves, when I'm making my bottom turn the wave is already crashing in front of me, and I have to straighten out or jump over the breaking wave.

My main suspicion is that I'm getting into the wave too late and maybe my pop up is a bit slower than it needs to be.  I can work on my pop up, but I still think that the late element might be something else.

Why might I be too late? I think it's because I'm a heavier guy.  I weigh 210+ (I'm 6'1), and due to NorCal currents/power, I find that I need more foam (average volume is 39-42L).  I've gone down in foam size (34L-36L), but paddling gasses me.  

My hypothesis is that because I have more foam, and because I'm heavier, I need to be deeper in the pocket and catch waves later.  I find that a lot of times I get sucked up the wave (from more foam) and while I can eventually paddle/drop in, it's nearly always critical.  I've seen many times guys smaller than me, positioned more on the shoulder and STILL getting into the wave before I would ever dream of.

Am I that weak?  Will losing weight help with this?  Am I just popping up too slow here?  Having a bigger board helps for sure (I get in nice and early with my log), but going much larger has it's own drawbacks (duck diving, control, steep faces, etc.)

Just wondering if anyone else whos on the heavier side has witnessed this, and how they were able to adjust accordingly.

I would say I'm an advanced beginner, been surfing for almost 1 year, can catch most waves, ride down the line on the face, still no bottom/top turns yet.

I've been surfing on a 7'0 (49L) but I've been struggling this summer on smaller days to catch waves consistently (most likely because of positioning and inefficient paddling I reckon)  but I really want to maximize fun, so was thinking to get a bigger board for those days.

1694555672.0,The M.O.A.R. rack. (Mother of all racks),"For those that live far from surf, like to do all of the things when you are on the road, and run a truck camper because you can't afford #vanlife here is a solution for you. In spring or fall in the PNW it's not unrealistic to do these 3 sports on a single short trip (an obvious application would be squamish/north shore riding, whistler skiing, and tofino surfing). But makes sense in Washington Oregon and California as well when it's not on fire. 

This is a velocirax 6 bike carrier with the central 2 slots removed. Initially I just used a block surf strap system centrally but dealing with the straps was annoying. Totally works though if you are in a budget. Verified for over a few thousand miles of rough driving.  Today I installed the Inno racks Inna446 which is a ratcheting locking rack for boards. I had to get creative with extra long bolts since it was designed for factory crossbars on suvs, but after making some shims and other creative liberties it turned out excellent and currently still accommodates 4 bikes. 

In fall velocirax is releasing their ski attachment which will allow me to have 2 bikes on one side, 3 boards centrally, and skis on the other side with all of it locked except for the skis. 

I add a ratchet strap over to minimize the slight movement of the rack when on rough roads or long trips. 

I've used it on boards up to 9'6. The camper blocks 90+ percent of the wind, and boards loaded bottom towards the rack makes the wind push right over the rocker of long boards. For ease of loading sometimes I put a wood board just strapped to the base of my velocirax as a platform for ease of one person loading.",surfing

I am sure this question has been asked before, and for that I apologize. I‚Äôve been surfing for about 7 months now, and love it. Mostly long boarding in SoCal. I come from a motorsports background and have always been fascinated by chassis design, setup, tuning, etc. 

With that in mind, I‚Äôd love any input on great resources on board design or why shapers make the choices they do. From books, to YouTube, to articles, im open to all!

I‚Äôve gone down the YouTube rabbit hole, and read a decent amount, enough to make my head swirl. The shapes are fascinating - it really makes you appreciate hand shaped boards and decisions. But, as im sure others can relate to, sometimes you have to find the ‚Äúright‚Äù resource for you to really get the concepts - I want to understand the why* of design beyond ‚Äúx does y.‚Äù

Meaning I can handle head high ground swell on a 6'0 HPSB thruster, late drops, solid bottom turn, up and down the face 5-6 times on a clean wave. My current goals are: generate speed, faster turns, more verticle turns, better form overall, and of course more work on my duckdive. I know I can do all of these by setting up a camera and posting footage here for review. But I progressed so much with a private coach a year ago, that I want to do it again. That trip was in Peniche, Portugal a year back where I hired a competitive shortboarder. The climax of that trip was he took me to Supertubos when it was 1.5 overhead which I certainly want to repeat. Other spots we went to were 15-20' which I paddled out for, wasn't ready for. I just priced the same place out but thought it'd be good to ask for other options here before committing. Especially because that area can get too big in winter.   


Timeframe is middle december and the budget is $2000. Prices right now for Peniche are: $550 flight from Newark, $50/per night room, $75 each coach sessions, bringing my own board. i dont mind going on the cheap as long as its safe and clean. thank you",surfing

1697236462.0,Matuse wetsuit owners - fit question,"I just took receipt of a Matuse Scipio (3/3) chest zip wetsuit and am have some fit concerns. Communication with Matuse has been slow and I need to make a decision on whether to keep or exchange in time for a trip that departs in 10 days.

I'm in that no man's land between L, LT, and XL and in many cases end up finding a really good fit when sizing down. 

For reference I'm 6'0"" / 200lb and an O'Neill L fits perfectly. Per their size chart I'm on the borderline in height and over in weight. XL has gaps all over (armpits, backs of knees, lower back, etc) and LT is way too long in arms and legs. 

The Matuse is proving to be a challenge which is compounded by the fact that I was only able to order 1 size option. Based on feedback from Matuse I ordered the XL and while it does fit I'm having two  issues:

1. There is some bunching in the armpits and above the elbows.
2. The rear of the collar is pulling away from my neck a bit. I can get it to lay flat if I pull the back of the suit up, but it resets to this position once I bend forward a few times. I suspect that once in the water the back of the suit will reset itself a bit and this will smooth out. 

Here are some images which illustrate: [https://imgur.com/a/JPWbFe7](https://imgur.com/a/JPWbFe7)

On top of that while the suit is definitely form-fitting and generally tight to the skin it's not *TIGHT* (like compressively tight) as I was expecting from a number of comments referencing Matuse and Yamamoto suits in general. In fact it was relatively easy to get on and off which is in stark contrast to my exiting 4/3 and 3/2 suits which are a bit of a struggle to get off the shoulders. 

So the question is whether or not the issues I'm having are enough to be concerned that the suit is going to be a leaky, cold, flushing mess. 

If I size down I'm pretty confident that the bunching in the armpits will resolve, but the collar is making me a bit concerned. The suit would also be compression-tight, which I'm OK with as long as it stretches and molds to fit.

If you have some experience with Matuse suits and how they tend to fit please let me know!

**Tl;dr:** Concerned about some fit issues with a Matuse Scipio (see image link above) and whether or not they will cause real problems in actual use. Keep it and surf it or send it back for an L or LT?

Saturday evening (30th) as the sun is going down, we're having a good time and we heard a lot of thrashing, something big out in the water.  I grab my binocs, start to scan and bam, ""holy shit, that looks like a shark fin, a big one!!"".  The rental had a sweet telescope right in the living room overlooking the bay so I run inside, get on it, sweep the area and yeah, ""damn, thats a great white fin, no doubt"".  Solid 3 foot fin slicing thru the water.  Wife goes to look and gone.  I had eyes on it for about 30 seconds total and then it was gone.  I've seen one other great white in Santa Cruz where I surf, the fin actually looks black out of the water, not the grey you'd expect.  Anyways, was all amped up, that was ""so cool"".  Next day, we're hiking out in Point Reyes, think we hit town (PRS) on the way back for lunch and my phone lights up once back in cell coverage.  Guy hit at wildcat beach.  Same shark? very unlikely but I keep wondering?  Wife and I had kayaks at the rental, she refused to go out the next day when the water was nice and calm!  haha...I didn't push it or go solo!

From there we went up to Mendocino, saw some great surf (rivermouth right outside of town was perfect one day) but was unable to get on it due to injury (and age at this point).  Some big fish in the water up that way but some good surf too...I must be getting old to debate it.

I'll be targeting mostly punchy, quick beach break, with mixed conditions, waist to OH.
My current daily is a Maysym 5'8. I'm 5'11 180-185lb. Home break is South/Central Florida, East Coast, near Ft. Pierce Inlet. Looking at a 5'6 or 5'7. Love shorter boards as the conditions get tight, they are easy to move into position, and I have a somewhat narrow stance. Enjoy my Seaside 5.5 on bigger days, but it can get crazy fast and lacks the pivot I enjoy with a Twin+trailer (which is what I have in my Maysym). My 5.7 seaside feels like a boat, and don't ride it much anymore. I'd probably be really happy with a custom 5.6 Seaside with a center box, slightly narrower with more thickness to keep the volume, but really hesitant to order that custom. I like the Maysym, but want a fishy tail and a bit shorter. Which brings me here, deciding between the Mick's Tape and a RNF 96.",surfing

1697035986.0,how to get over fear of waves,"so this might be a slightly different post since I am not a surfer but thought you could all help me since this getting swept up by waves is a regular occurrence for any surfer.

I'll try to keep it short: I was in biarritz (atlantic ocean) in july when I went to the beach to go swimming. the waves were horrendously high and it was not recommended to go in but there were many people in the water anyway (+surfers in the distance).

I was pretty scared but thought it was one of those moments where I just had to take the leap and it would be fine. the waves seemed fine one moment and then out of control the next (unpredictable basically) so I stood at the beach for a while before running in.

first wave when I went in was okay, when the second one approached there were two children at the top and all I thought was cool theyre gonna fall onto my face and break my nose.
no way of even attempting to swim under the wave as there were too many people in the water.
so I got the washing maschine treatment, immediately let go of my sunglasses (4 weeks old and worth $90).
second wave didn't hit me as hard, after that I was washed up back on the beach.

I could hardly speak after, swallowed some salt water that also went up my nose, had a ton of sand in my swimsuit/hair/ears, I was basically in shock.

and ever since I keep thinking back and wish this hadnt happened. has anyone ever made a similar experience?
it feels like I'm horribly scared of the ocean now. I've always had a lot of respect for the tides and the power that the water holds but it seems some deep trust in me just broke.
and ive been pushed into the sand before by smaller waves/closer to the beach but this time it was in deep waters where I couldnt even stand/ was pushed down several meters.

I figured since surfers get swept up in waves much bigger than what I was subjected to some of you might be able to offer some advice.

1697063230.0,"Who do you think should've won the 2005 title, Kelly or Andy?","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVTR2QVXpTI&ab\_channel=WorldSurfLeague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVTR2QVXpTI&ab_channel=WorldSurfLeague) I was watching the Andy Iron's documentary, kissed by god. I'm not sure who won, but I gotta say all it did was make me fall in love with Kelly Slater even more. What a fucking guy, somehow many years ago I thought he was a bit of an asshole, but man people are just jealous as hell, he might be one of the people I admire the most, as a person first, as a surfer second.

UNRELATED RANT INCOMING:

The high five with Rob Machado for example, I don't believe for a second he masterminded that move to get priority, and when he told Andy at the final that he was his brother no matter what, then again, I think he's just that lovable guy. And they show that in Andy's documentary, Kelly was a nice guy, that of course was competitive, but he was the guy you could bring home to your parents. Andy was the mean guy that would get depressed if he lost and would talk about crushing Kelly's dreams and whatnot. (I know he was bipolar though, but it doens't change those facts). Kelly admits he told him he was old, and bald and over the hill, that's to me what horrible sportmanship is like. But to say to a guy that you love him as a brother regardless of who wins that's amazing.

Plus of course if you were going to do that, you'd do it at the final. I think Kelly is just so real and honest that some people have a hard time understanding that and wanted to desperately seek hidden intentions and motives.

&#x200B;

By the way I completely hate Andy Iron's girlfriend, sure, she didn't know he had a world title, but she met him and ""fell in love"" after he won it, that's what I consider a coincidence, and the way she talks about Kelly  especially just makes me cringe

&#x200B;

And idk, so it's hard to judge the contest given that I'm definitely biased towards Kelly. But what do you guys think? Should Andy have won that year? (To me just the balls alone to get that wave with 30 seconds left is cooler than whatever Andy did, plus he barely fell, he was almost on top of the board and if he had pulled it off compeltley I think it would be obvious he should've won)",surfing
1696968846.0,Tecate Police Shenanigans,"tl;dr --- coming home from a Baja surf trip, surfboards on the roof, we were targeted by Mexican police and prevented from progressing to the US border unless we paid a $200 fee for a ""traffic infraction."" 

After a really nice surf / camp trip, yesterday my friend, son and I were in the border line to head back into the states at Tecate. After about an hour in the line, we got to the point where the single line splits into two. We chose the right lane, but noticed too late that several vehicles ahead of us were trying to get out of the right lane we were in, and merge into the left lane. This was causing the right line to stop. After waiting about 10 minutes at a dead stop, my buddy got out of the car and walked up to the US CBP agent at the gate. He asked the agent if the right gate was open, and the agent said yes, but that the Mexicans had placed a barricade blocking movement in that lane. My buddy looked, and sure enough a barricade had been placed at the font of the line for that US entry gate. The US agent said although the gate was open, he could not do anything about the barricade as it was in Mexican territory.

When my buddy got back to our car, he said we'd need to get into the left lane because the right lane had been barricaded by what seemed like some homeless guy wearing a reflective consruction vest. But as we tried to merge into the left lane (thank you sweet lady for letting us merge), two Mexican motocycle cops rode up, and one of them parked in front of our car. I asked him what's up and he said we'd need to merge into the left lane, but that we would then have to exit that lane back into Tecate and drive to the back of line. He acted as if we had taken cuts (which I know is a big no no at Tecate). But this was not the case. There were dozens of cars in the right lane, all there after having been in the single lane for nearly an hour. The US gate for that lane was open, but that random dude had moved a barricade to block progress. The second cop then blocked all left lane traffic, causing a gap, and motioned us to drive into that lane then exit back into Tecate. I asked him why we couldn't just proceed to the US border in the left lane, and he said if we did it would be an infraction.

I really didn't want to drive back to the end of the line and wait for another hour, so I asked him how much the ""ticket"" for the ""infraction"" would be. He smiled and said, ""200 dollars."" I offered him $40. He laughed and motioned for us to exit the line back into Tecate proper. I didn't want to pay any more that $40 for this kind of bullshit, and not wanting to risk being fucked with again, we decided to exit the Tecate line and drive to Otay, where we crossed without issues in about 30 minutes.

Even if the reported number is only accounting for more developed nations, that's still a pool of at least 1 billion entering their waters annually as a reasonable estimate. 

52 out of 1 billion is infinitesimal.

Hopefully this eases some people's anxiety, but if not come on in to the ED and get some Ativan.",surfing

I want to buy a second hand shortboard. I am 75kg and 1m78 tall.

I want to practice rollers, cutbacks, roundhouses in small hollow waves and 3ft+ waves. I've been surfing for 20 years on and off, and want to get better at shortboarding.

Some dude has 3 to sell :

\- Cabianca 'The Game'  5‚Äô11 19' 2'5/16 27L  EPS Epoxy (Carbon Roots, 9 stripes on deck similar to Spinetek) 550‚Ç¨- Al Merrick Two Happy (Spinetek)  5‚Äô11 18'3/4 2'5/16 27L5  750‚Ç¨- DHD Stabbed 86  5'11 18'7/8 2'5/16 27L 650‚Ç¨

All boards are almost new and swallow tail

They seem quite similar (dims, tail, single to double concave).

For now i'm leaning towards DHD, i like the outline. I had a Pukas The Game (PU) i really liked but it lost its pop after some years.

Do you have any advice to help me choose between those three ?

We had some great swell these last few days here in the UK, pretty big and powerful. I'm riding my 7'6 mal thruster as usual, and I had a few waves where I attempted a deep bottom turn and just ended up sliding out and getting a good pounding (?) afterwards.

The board is a pretty chunky shape with big round rails. I never really had an issue with sliding out before but the waves are usually a lot weaker, I feel like the extra speed combined with the rail shape may have caused the slide but I'm not totally sure.

My understanding is that a full rail is more forgiving/stable, so maybe it's just bad technique? Would a board with a harder rail help with bottom turns on the cleaner and more powerful waves?

1696858970.0,Novice anecdotal report of trying to surf in Okinawa,"Tldr: hard to luck into waves. Make a plan for the right spot for the season, bring boards or confirm a rental, maybe get a local guide/pro. 

writing this up in case it helps someone else since I struggled to get a sense of the place. So I just got home from a family trip (spouse, two kids ages 8&10) to Japan. We spent 4 days of the trip in Okinawa to relax, and enjoy the beach. I planned to spend one or two of the mornings in the water like I always do when family trips take me to surf destinations (bali, El Salvador, nicaragua, Mexico, Hawaii‚Ä¶): just find a shop, rent a board, ask where to surf and figure it out. 

This did not work. I was only on the main island with no time or plan to get a boat to good waves, and even with the typhoon off taiwan pushing swell, I got pretty skunked.

Difficulties: most of the known and ok for tourists waves are pretty fickle, from what people told me. Wind and swell direction matter a ton.
They‚Äôre also mainly high-tide only (so 2 hrs on either side) breaks because if shallow reef. 
There are two, maybe three places to ‚Äúrent boards‚Äù from what I could tell online, but all were closed Wednesday, so that was out. 

I ended up getting help from Danny of Happy Surfing Okinawa. (Google or IG). He runs a beginners surf camp and can send his partner to take better surfers hunting for decent waves in the van. (I didn‚Äôt do this because I was crunched for time, but everywhere was blown out so that crew ended up at the beginner spot anyway). And he obviously uses foam boards, and doesn‚Äôt rent out anything else. So he was great and I did my best to make a decent morning of 1-2 and super choppy conditions. He was rad, did his best, and runs a good surf school. 

Nonetheless, I wish I had skipped it and spent more time on uruma snorkeling.

Mine was at Dreamland, Bali around 2016. At the time I was pretty inexperienced in anything overhead and it was mostly overhead sets. I paddled out through the channel and sat at the right as that's where most of the crowd was that day but I got intimidated by the size of the sets and the crowd so decided to paddle across the channel to the left which was where I usually surfed and there was hardly anyone out there. Caught a smaller set wave and paddled back out and was feeling pretty good. Then all of a sudden the horizon just started to lift up like it was being pushed up from below by some massive unseen force and it just kept on rising up until it had formed a grotesquely perfect looking turquoise wall of terror.

Usually when you get caught out by a sneaker set you react quickly and take action, but I was just stuck in a suspended animation state of pure disbelief. This couldn't possibly be happening. The wave was so unfathomably large to me it might as well have been the sky scraper high wave from Deep Impact. I just sat there immobilized by terror as it broke about 30 feet in front of me creating a mountain of rapidly approaching whitewater.

I'm not sure why I didn't just bail my board but as I went to duck dive I instinctually turned sideways at the last moment like you would if you were about to get hit front on by a bus. The board was violently ripped from my hands immediately and I got the worst spin cycle tumbling of my life. When I came up I had just enough time to get a breath in before the next wall of whitewater hit. My board got creased and I was pretty spooked for a while afterwards but otherwise unscathed. When I was sitting on the beach afterwards trying to process what happened an Aussie guy came back in and as he sat back down with his mates I overheard him saying ""Mate! What about that set!"".",surfing

1696810116.0,Possible Torn Hip Labrum. MRI Clear. Very Painful. Been Months. Please Help!,"Hello,

I believe I torn my right hip labrum around February/March of this year. I probably didn't really figure this out until around July.

The only thing I can really remember is that I bought a new bike that was kind of like a BMX bike, barely did anything with it however, the cadence was extremely off. I also worked a lot out in the GYM and used the Elliptical. I do remember riding the Elliptical one time and pain kicked in around 20 min around the back of my right SI joint. I pushed through the pain for another 10 min because it wasn't that bad. Also, we did move around the March/April time frame, it was a light move but a move none the less. Actually, considering it was probably a pretty heavy move. Then lastly, the only thing I think I may have did was stretch it out too much with weights. I remember feeling like my right leg needed some stretching so I put a weight on it while sitting Indian style. Nothing crazy, just like a 5 LB or 10 LB in order to push it a little while holding it.

Not sure if any of this torn my labrum or not but fast forward to July. My right hip was hurting so bad to include my right SI joint that I went to a Back Doctor and a Hip Doctor. The Back Doctor was decent however, the Hip Doctor PA was extremely rude. I ended up getting an MRI on my Back and my Right Hip after taking regular X-Rays per the Back Doctor. Both MRI's are clear except for the right Hip does have a Minor Impingement from I believe a small bone spur that is digging into my Femur Ball that is trying to heal itself creating a Fluid Nodule over and over again.

No one really gave me any answers I think because they didn't know what to do. My MRI's came back clean with no visual tear and the hip doctor people blew me off. Fast forward a few weeks and again the hip pain was so intense I went to a different Urgent Care that is Orthopedics only.  I met an Angel there. A PA that looked at everything I had. My X-Ray's, MRI's, listen to my story, etc. They said they knew exactly what I had. A damaged internal hip because of a bone spur. They have a special MD that they refer this to and they perform this Surgery 24/7.

Hip Arthroscopy Surgery

I was re-leaved to have some kind of answers because no one else did. I went to go see this MD and they gave me a Steroid Cortisone Shot. It did help and the pain mostly subsided. I would say for about six weeks on the dot. Then I figure I would test it out and go for a walk and boy it came back hard core. I would say the pain when it is really pissed off is about an 8/9. Completely debilitating.  I went for a 30 min walk and afterwards I would have to lay down on the opposite side and ice my hip for 30 min to be able to even stand again.

Things I can no longer do:

\-Walk longer than 5 min

\-Run

\-Mow the Yard

\-Go on any day trip and walk around

So I went back to my MD and told them everything. They are 100% convinced this is a Texted Book case of a Labrum Tear and they have offered to preform the Surgery. This Doctor has done it 2000+ times and has Good Ratings. I have all the information and they are literally just waiting on my phone call to schedule the Surgery.

Preset Day

So naturally, I started researching this on the internet and low and behold THIS is a MASSIVE topic on the internet. Tons and Tons of people video logging it and talking about. Strangely, though doesn't seem like there is any FRESH information on this though. Everything is around 3+, 5+, or even 10+ years old. Does this mean that everyone currently having this problem is just getting the surgery and moving on. Not really talking about it anymore? Have the Doctors mastered this procedure now?

My findings were that you could have a really great surgery, be a lot better off than you were before however, you many never be 100%. Meaning have realistic expectations of what you are going to get out of Surgery. I am leaning towards this because I believe this is a lot better chance of at least being able to walk again. I mean I would rather have the option to walk again than not have the option. Meaning if the Surgery is not the best outcome, well I at least tried. I mean I can't walk right now.

However, I have also heard a lot of people try to not get the Surgery. They do admit they have sacrificed a lot and can no longer run or do activities but they manage their every day lives I believe getting by the best they can. I am not sure I like this option.

Then you have a couple of miracle stories to where some people say they have heal their labrum even though all evidence says that you cannot. I think one person said it took like 10 years. Seriously?

I am not sure I have the stamina or the capability to do this. I do want to try to the best of my ability.

Enter in.

PT - Physical Therapy

I have been in PT for 3 weeks now. I felt a little better, so much so I worked out at home my own way. Big Mistake. Completely took a few steps back with major pain. (I did a minor ab routine) I will not do that again. However, to me the pain is so great I want to say yes to surgery and get this over with. However, my mind is saying have you really gave PT everything you got first? Could you be one of those 20% people to heal themselves out of this without surgery?

Am I a big baby? I mean maybe people deal with much worse pain levels and even run through this kind of pain. Seriously? No Way. How?

Should I somehow become a super hero and fight though this pain and PT and beat this on my own somehow?

Here is my current thought process.

Try PT for another 4-6 weeks. If I make significant process. Delay Surgery.

I don't think I can make it and within 2-3 weeks out I am going to cave and schedule the surgery.

Pain Levels

1-2 - Almost constant throughout the day (Sometimes NASID Sometimes Not)

4-6 - Mid Day, office work around the job or house (bad days) (NASID)

7-8 - Mow the Yard, 15+ min walk, Day Trip (need immediate rest and ice, hot bath, NASID)

Help!

So please, what would you do? What have you done? What is the latest information regarding this? I just don't want to get the Surgery and find out that the Labrum Tear wasn't the actually problem. I mean sometimes I feel its a hurt ligament or other things like what is listed below:

\-Sacrotuberious Ligament issue

\-SI Joint issue

\-Pulled Groin

\-Anything else in the Pelvic Region?

\-IT Band

Side note, all blood work is clear, X-Ray's are clear, MRI's are clear. However, I know this Pain is real and not in my Head. I mean in either case they can clean up the bone spur, look around with the scope and fix any problems they find if I do the surgery. Thus far, I am leaning towards Surgery and maybe think I have 3-6 weeks of PT left in my mind in order for a Miracle to happen before I call and schedule the surgery.

I am just so tired of literally doing nothing except rest, ice and laying around. I know it will hurt if I do anything. I am doing PT 3 days a week, but is that enough? I am hoping I can get those few steps that I went back to a baseline of at least not hurting doing nothing.

I mean I could possibly do something if I ice that area, stack up on NASID's and do something minor but I will probably pay for it later.

At this point I am working on progressing my top to bottom surfing and am looking for a board that I can ride in bigger and better waves, (on 4-5 foot days my puddle jumper feels bulky and the rail almost feels like it‚Äôs gonna skip out on steep drops. This is absolutely somewhat related to my level of surfing and it‚Äôs not fully the boards fault I‚Äôm sure, but it does feel like something with less volume could work well for me on those days?) 

I found a used 5‚Äô6 album twinsman (30 liters) for a great deal and am wondering if this board is going to feel like too drastic of a change, or if it‚Äôs going to progress my surfing in the way I want it to. Does anyone have experience with it and know if it makes a good daily driver for that average to good 4-7 foot range? my local surf shop recommended a pyzel phantom but new boards are expensive and i haven‚Äôt been able to find anything used.  

I want a board that is above my skill level so I can grow with it (I am also young and surfboards are not something I can find money for often). The board seems like it could be a great fit, I‚Äôd really appreciate any thoughts, or feel free to gaslight me into spending money if you hate the way these posts saturate the r/surfing feed. 

Tldr; album twinsman for first higher performance board, coming from grovelor. Also is 5‚Äô6 too low volume for 5‚Äô9 and 140lbs?  

Much love.

Edit: the twinsman is in great condition, has some minor pressure dents. $600.",surfing

1696610621.0,Healing from a traumatic surf accident,"It was my first custom-made fish. I was ordering from a local legend in shaping. We met, and he spent 
 better part of an hour talking to me, feeling out what I wanted, where I planned to surf it and in what types of waves, etc

Weeks went by. Expected delivery date passed. I gave it more time, and eventually called him. He told me he was behind due to workload, but that It would be soon. 

I finally got the call that my new board was ready, and I went to his shaping studio to pick it up. There were a couple other people there waiting to meet with the shaper, a couple of friends of his that were just hanging out, and his assistant. When he saw me enter, he looked up and smiled, excused himself from a conversation, and showed me to the board. There it lay, beautifully glistening beneath the lights. I walked over to it, and everyone in the room oohed and ahhed, commenting on its beauty.

I picked it up, held it above me to examine it and appreciate its beauty, when for some goddamn reason it slipped from my hands and fell right onto its tail, hitting the concrete floor with a sickening crack.

The room fell silent. I looked at the shaper. He looked at me with an expression that I can only describe as infinite disappointment and awe. I placed the board down onto a pair of saw horses and examined the tail. Cracked right through to the foam.

An otherwordly voice broke the silence. One of the guys in the room said loudly and with a laugh, ""Well, now that you got that out of the way go out and rip."" 

It was sage advice for sure. But at times, like now, the trauma of that accident still haunts me.",surfing

(1) 6'0 modern fish with twins. High wave count, fast carving rides, but 30% I feel like I dont have enough fin to hold when it barrels(2) 6'0 Dominator setup with thrusters. Medium wave count and I obviously turn easier and faster than the twin fish. When I do catch, 50% of the rides are good and 50% I get bucked off because the tail section feels too wide. Maybe this board isnt ideal for a wave this big. Or maybe I just need more practice on it?(3) 6'8 custom shaped, very narrow, 19"" wide with pulled in nose. Lower wave count but when it catches, I have far more control. It looks and feels like it was designed for a bigger wave so maybe this Im on the right track with this one.

(4) 8'2"" custom shaped swallow tail with quads. Down rails with chine, high rocker, heavily foiled. Wave count is very high, but the length and fin config prevent it from turning fast. More importantly, I'd rather improve my shorter-board skills, so scratch this one out.

I see boards like the Firewire Houdini, but these conditions are rare, so it seems silly to buy another board just for this wave type. Perhaps I should think about spreading my quiver out a bit. For example, have two 6'0 shortboards, one as a daily-driver and one higher-performance specs",surfing

1696226660.0,Who has terrible eyesight? What's your experience?,"I surf alone 98% of the time. My eyesight is also really terrible, like I can't see something clearly 6 feet from my face. 
Surfing is the only thing other than sleep that i still do without glasses/ contacts. 

I wear my glasses down to the beach and choose where I'm going to paddle out and sit because when i take off my glasses my vision of the ocean just turns into an incoherent mess. Like I've gone down to check it without glasses and been like wow there's no one out and my mates will be like wtf dude, there's like 30 people out. 
Even when there are lots of other people in the water i rarely have an interaction with someone because i just can't see their face. I can just see a blurry blob. Over time I've basically just learnt to completely ignore people. Might sound like a jerk move but after years of saying hi to people only to realise they weren't even looking at me, or responding to someone only to realise they are looking past me talking to someone else, you just get sick of having awkward interactions.
For example, a couple months ago I was surfing a small point break with my partner, she is still learning. We were sitting behind the pack just taking small leftovers, i rode one in. As i was paddling back out I saw her paddleing out into the crowd. I whistled, got her attention and waved for her to paddle back to me. I didn't know why she decided to head out to the peak but she definitely wasn't at the level yet. Anyway, she hesitated to paddle back to me but she finally did and as she got near me i realised my terrible mistake. It wasn't my partner. It was a local Japanese man, different gender, different coloured board, different in every way except they were both wearing a hat and i couldn't tell the difference. I actually whistled at one of the locals and waved them into me. 
We had a good laugh but it was super embarrassing. 

Waves also come in blurry blobs but I've learnt to read the ocean well based on rises and falls on the horizon and changes in colour.

I actually really struggle to enjoy myself when I'm surfing with other people or interacting with them. 

Part of me really wants to start surfing with contacts, but it's already an expensive hobby and i worry about eye infections. Part of me wants to get some prescription surf goggles and turn into like a sort of kooky superhero.

But then there's also a part of me that appreciates the unknown. I love being able to zone out of everything and just be in my own little world. I was seriously anxious about surfing by myself for years, i always wanted to paddle out with a friend so i had a reference point for where i was but I'd usually lose them after one wave anyway and spend the session by myself. 

Now that I'm really comfortable reading the ocean from instinct and feel, I'm hesitant to get my vision back. But it does make surfing unfamiliar spots and rock walks/jumps difficult. 

I know that if i use vision i will never go back to not wearing my glasses. The same thing happened with skating. I couldn't skate wearing glasses for ages because it would throw my depth perception way off. But as soon as i got used  to it i stopped being able to skate without them. 

I actually used contacts for a surf a few years ago. I did it once and it was mind blowing, the clarity was out if this world. But at the time I didn't have more and i couldn't afford to keep buying them. I also lost one in that session.
 
I would love to hear people's experiences. 

Those who use contacts, do you use dailys and a new pair every session? Do you wear monthlys and just chuck them in the dishwasher? Do you still surf if you don't have contacts or if you lose one in the surf does that end the session? 

Does anyone wear prescription glasses/goggles?",surfing

Started surfing almost 20 years ago but had to take the past 5 years off after a nasty motorcycle accident messed up my shoulder pretty good.

Back into the swing of things this spring and no problems with cruisy cutbacks, but want to work back towards ""top to bottom"" surfing like I could (albeit not well) before my injury. 

My current ""daily driver"" is a 7'2 (50L) Chilli Mid Strength. It's been a stellar board but a lot to swing around. Also been on a 6'4 Rawson Alien (43L) a lot this summer - fast, very very flat, lots of paddle power, but in anything above chest high if I'm not getting in on the shoulder I've been getting hung up by the lack of nose rocker (burying the nose when trying to get on rail before hitting the flats). Before my injury my bigger day board was a 6'6 CI Black Beauty (35L) which I still have but haven't touched in many years. 

I'm hoping the Pyzalien2 XL in either a 6'0 (34L) or 6'2 (38L) would slot in somewhere well, fast with a good amount of paddle power but more rocker to handle a bit more size and be more maneuverable to progress on as I get back into the sport. 

Countering all this, I am far from surfing any of my boards to their full potential and beyond what I perceive to be a nose rocker issue with the Alien I'm sure I'm not being held back by my equipment at all.",surfing

I think she drove a pretty beat up van, sienna or something. When she was in the line up, she would talk to herself, a lot of time just cussing up and down. She could surf ok, she had a medium long board I think, and whenever she caught a wave , her arms were flailing out of control as that was her way of pumping and doing maneuvers. 

I don't remember when at I last saw her, but must have been at least 5 years. I've always wonder what happened to her. I hope she didn't burn the wrong person and got murdered for it. She's the type of person that can disappear from society, and no one would ever notice, since I think she was homeless living in her van.

1696019088.0,New board suggestions (also dimensions),"Hello, I am looking to get a new board shaped (Lima - Peru). I am 1.74cm / 5 9 ft - 74kg/165 lbs

I currently surf an epoxy 5 7 (30.8 lt) gofish shaped from a local shaper which has helped my surfing a ton. I really like the speed down the line, the flow, and when I find it's sweet spot (2 - 4 ft) it really handles well. However, I think when it gets over over 5 feet it starts to struggle; I feel (maybe because of shape / because its epoxy) it starts lifting up, and in general, its limiting my progression (want to do a little more sharp turns).

I felt it struggled in this size of wave (6-7ft imo)

https://preview.redd.it/rmwiqh2ho8rb1.jpg?width=3456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5d38f820651bc284e335eb51987f946137a7857

Two weeks ago, I got a 5 6 (27. 7lt) ci twin pin shaped from a another local shaper (different from the first) for bigger waves (6ft) . Unfortuneatly, it didn't perform as I wanted (felt too small, didnt float nice, and paddling in for big waves was hard). I don't if I asked for dimensions too small for me (dimensions from william allioti video) or maybe the materials weren't as solid. I ended up dinging the bottom and ripping one of its fin box in a wipeout on my 4th session.

Because of this, I'm looking to shape a new more permformancy daily driver with the first shaper. Something that has a good paddle, flow down the line, lay backs and some vertical surf. Soemthing that can habdle bigger days, but also work in medium surf (3 - 8 ft). Im thinking of the cc lanesplitter or maybe album twinsman/light bender. Anyone have any experience with any of those boards or could recommed a shape I should try? People who owned seaside/gofish, what board would you recommend? Please take into account that this board will be made in epoxy.

**Litreage question:**

How much lt do you think I could cut for new daily driver. I feel like the 27.7 i ordered the twin pin was too litte, but I'm also skeptical that the material/product wasn't as solid. I'm thinking of around a 5 6 lane spitter with 28.4 lt, but I'm afraid I might be ordering too small again.

**TLDR**

1.74cm / 5 9 ft - 74kg/165 lbs looking for a new performancy daily driver that handle a little bit of bigger waves, but also work in medium surf (3 - 8ft). With speed down the line, flow and some vertical surfing. I'm transitioning from a 5 7 go fish.

Jumped off the rocks and realized this was serious. Everyone was on 7-foot guns, and I was severely mistaken. Tried to paddle into a few bombs (I'm fairly familiar with how the waves work at Fiz, so didn't end up getting caught out at all as the period was so high you could time the sets fine).

After a while, decided all was hopeless and began the mission to paddle in. Fistral, like many other deep water beach breaks - is mushy on the big bombs, and absolutely detonates on the inside. So I hatched my plan. Wait for the massive set (sets were only 2 waves thankfully, every \~15 mins), then gun it and take one on the head and in.

So - after the next set, I get my head down and gun it to the shore. It's a solid 300 feet to paddle in, with nuts currents but I just know as long as I take a 6 footer on the head, it'll be fine. 

Just my luck - a freak set hits as soon as I'm in the middle of the impact zone. Turn around, gun it try and get under them. First one is a medium 6 footer - thankfully just get under it.

The second one - I was not so lucky. This freak of satan, dredging, evil, lurching 10 footer was baring it's teeth directly on me. You know when you just know, instantly that you're fucked? Like you don't even bother? I distinctly remembered laughing outloud and exclaiming this is where I die.

Unlike every single massive set wave - this one broke top to bottom, full barrel. I make the business decision that against 99% of Reddit's advice, I'm ditching my board and swimming under on this one.

I distinctly remember seeing the lip launching down on me as I sink under, and just mentally preparing for the beating of a lifetime. Bear in mind - I haven't even been surfing 2 years yet. And that's not 2 years Hawaii - that's 2 years in the UK. We don't get hurricanes. So as I'm underwater - I'm pretty sure I'm about to be eating my own feet.

I feel the initial impact like a truck to my back, but somehow - I didn't get sucked back over and detonated. My leash didn't snap either. I got that super lucky trick where you get sucked back and spat out the back. 

Genuinely surprised I was alive - I went to grab my board. Got it underneath me, and adrenaline was pumping so hard I went to paddle for the smaller 5 foot wave to get to the shore - as I pressed down on the board to get in, it folded in my hands. That last wave had landed directly on the stringer and decimated it. I cant imagine what taking the direct impact of that wave on my head would have felt like.

Thankfully - I body boarded the next white water in, and was out for another day. Borrowing a friends 6 foot shortboard now (yay for adequate board length).

I've now decided I have to actually take big(ger) wave surfing as something serious - and get the bloody equipment for it. Everyone was out on a 7 foot gun, don't take a fucking toothpick out in serious surf. Respect the dang ocean. I think it's kinda easy to gaslight yourself into still being a beginner surfer - so you don't need ""serious"" board. But the only way you're gonna get that experience when you're ready is to give it a shot. This power and size is \*right\* on the edge of my comfort zone. I'd have been shitting it - but I could have swam in had my leash broke, and the sets were very very lully. Had it have been any bigger, and any less mushy on the sets - no way would I have gone.

But yes. Lesson learned. Try not to send it too hard, folks. Great story tho - and I did quite enjoy the walk up the beach with a folded board as onlookers look at you like you've just 1v1'd tyson fury.",surfing

People were wearing their surf leashes around their neck and on all fours, which seems very ergonomic when pig dogging in the tube. some people had their wetsuit hoods covering their entire face with zippers around their mouth for breathability.

Some men were shirtless and wearing shorts (I'm assuming it's for the board short convention the street over), neoprene banana hammocks (Europeans must travel well!) and some even not wearing any clothes at all (I think it's so they can try on new wetsuits quickly and efficiently) 

I was loving the vibe so I stripped off my Smartwool shirt, Patagonia pants and my Allbirds and tried on some wears.  There were some wetsuits that were constricting, but they definitely seemed to retain heat pretty well. 

My favorite wetsuit was a long john that didn't have the middle part of the lap/buttox area, which the owner said allowed for ""easy entry and exit and an increased ride performance"".

* **Shoulders** ([straight across back of neck](https://tailor.fandom.com/wiki/Shoulder_Width_(measurement)) \- end points are middle of shoulder): 22""
   * deltoids literally stick out sideways, adding to this measurement in practice

I've tried 2 O'Neill wetsuits and a couple of no-name ones from Amazon. Here's their size chart: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V7D9N1F?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details&th=1&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V7D9N1F?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1&psc=1)

The most recent and best fitting wetsuit I tried was a ""large-short"" O'Neill Epic. The legs, crotch, waist, and lower chest fit **perfectly.** Once I tried zipping up the neck it was like I was wearing a corset. Restricted breathing and movement.

I'm worried the next size up (XL short) is going to be baggy around the waist because its lowest measurement (35"") is 2"" wider than my actual waist. An XL might be very long too, considering I'm only 5'7.

1695420876.0,Help me pick a Twin Fin Set-Up,"So I am getting a new custom fish and I am looking at different fin options for weak mushy beach break waves.  In the winter we can get some nice waves, but we also get a lot of wind slop.  This is going to be my all around board.  It is a 6‚Äô4 big guy fish - I am 200 lb and almost died from COVID.  I was in a coma on a vent for 2 months and supposed to have a lung transplant.  I still have some lung scarring so a little extra float is unfortunately needed until I lose some weight and hopefully build my lungs back.  If I get back into shape it will be a great grovel board or a fantastic point break board.  The break is a little point breakish as it wraps around the jetty on a decent swell.

I have surfed for 30 years and can carve well and I have always been a powerful surfer so I am leaning towards a larger fin.  In my old fish I had some Mark Richards style fins (before FCS marketed the MR fins) with a small glasses in nubster style trailer.  It was more of a performance style fish that I had custom made in 2001 before we had so many fin options.  The board was like magic, but it is just to small for me at this point.  The new board will be a larger version of my old high performance style fish.

The fins I am looking at are the Britt Merrick Twin Fin, Mick Fanning Twin Fin, MR Free Ride, MR twin Fin and the Machado Keel.  I want something that will help beat out section and give me a little extra lift and drive while still allowing for vertical surfing.  Right now the BMT, MF and Free Ride seem like the best choices.

I'm fine with locals regulating a break in a low-key way if there are lots learners / assholes in the lineup. But I don't think living closer to the beach than someone else should give you the right to ignore basic surf etiquette. ",surfing

1695315420.0,"Got scared, went home.","So I'm on a surf trip with my wife and 6 month old baby, neither of whom surf. I gotta say, it's really intimidating to roll up to a break to hop in for a session. I thought I'd get a sunset session in last night, at a spot that I had been to a couple times, at low tide. This time was high tide and while getting in was easy, getting out looked like it could be kooked pretty hard. I stood with my wettie on, board in hand, and watched. Conditions looked pretty good, head high at a perfect right hand point/reef setup, slightly choppy, nothing I can't handle. I watched a couple guys battle the rip for easily 20 minutes while waiting for a wave to bring them to the little patch of sand among rocks. Another guy timed the regular spot perfectly and hopped out no worries. Light was fading and I just decided to no-go. I likely would have been fine but I really don't want to be the guy to do something dumb. I guess more paddle fitness would give me more confidence, and more open water swimming practice, 'cause that shit is difficult. I can swim a kilometer in a pool without too much difficulty but swimming in the ocean is way harder! My home break is boat access and cold af so I don't get practice swimming in beach break or navigating rocky ins and outs. I've been kinda down on myself about not hopping in but the spot is known for being pretty challenging. I'm used to being able to push myself really hard at alpine climbing and ski mountaineering but man, surfing is so humbling. I'm trying not to suck at it, and sometimes I feel like I don't, but then it makes me set my cup down like nothing else. I guess that's what makes it so rewarding. Thanks for attending my Ted talk. If anyone has advice or anecdotes, please share. Bonus, who can guess the spot?",surfing

1695310260.0,Koa Rothman's latest tips for the North Shore apply to everywhere.,"[Do's and Don'ts Surfing North Shore](https://youtu.be/oLMszsOisVs?si=IiWTojNwGzpGG702)

TLDR;

Do's:

1. Listen to lifeguards
2. Be Respectful to the regulars/locals - Be nice
3. Bring the right equipment - everyone is surfing to progress and have fun - be prepared - wear a leash.
4. Know what the swell is doing. (one minute the swell can suck, but an hour later it can be overhead - know the forecast)
5. Stretching and warming up - from a 29 y.o. talking about preventing injuries
6. Know your limits - ""if in doubt, don't go out""
7. take a lesson - show aloha to north shore coaches like in Haleiwa
8. Time your paddle out - when to paddle out ""very tricky to master...everyone I know professional surfers still get smoked...burn so much more energy than you needed to.""
9. Take turns with the people your surfing with - if you just caught a wave, let someone else go
10. Please clean up your trash - ""We as surfers need to conscious of how we treat the beach""

Don'ts

1.  Don't paddle into a surfers way when they are on a wave - ""the most frustrating thing as a surfer...I would rather take a whole set on the head to stay out of someone's way""
2. Don't paddle out around everyone and try to get a wave - don't paddle out into a group and take the first wave that comes in
3. Don't Surf Pipeline - you will be competing the the best surfers in the world who will be having a bad day
4. Don't snake anyone on a wave - paddle around someone to get deeper to call them off. ""you don't do it"" 
5. Don't drop in on people - ""you can put someone in harm's way...especially in the North Shore you could hurt someone or hurt yourself...and you could get beat up for it.""
6. Don't paddle for a wave and pull back - ""if you paddle for a wave and you don't go, to me in my mind, that's an automatic, ok this guys not going to go on any waves, he is not serious about catching waves...don't even paddle for a wave if you're not serious about going.""
7. Don't Panic - ""it is very easy to start panicking...relax, stay calm, get some breaths in.""
8. Don't drive fast on the back roads -Especially on Ke Nui Road on the North Shore since it is a residential street with families and kids that live there.",surfing

As I surf in coldish waters, the next one I got with the external liquid seams (no tape inside). I couldn't tell if indeed was any warmer, and 2 years later all the liquid seam is cracking and beneath it there are some holes where the panel are glued. 

Do you feel the liquid seams restrict movement compared to GBS w/ tape? I wonder if it just makes me work harder and not provide that much extra insulation.

We already know we can steal your car/truck/van if its under the wheel or in your 'trailer hitch safe'. 

Solution:  Almost all car manufacturers have an 'emergency' key that comes out of your FOB by pushing a little button. You bring THAT key with you in your trunks (usually have a handy string to loop around it so you don't lose it) or your wetsuit key pocket. 

Google '**how to remove emergency key for (YEAR MODEL MAKE) FOB**' and you will learn how to get your little key out. 

How to lock my doors if the FOB is in the car? Your manufacturer knows this needs to happen. You take the emergency key with you and leave the FOB in the car.

Lock all the non driver doors manually then lock the driver door with your little emergency key and you are all set!

No more losing your keys up your prison purse for the Dr. to retrieve or losing them all in the sand or watching the local homeless guy driving away in your windowless ~~molester~~ van.

I think I view it as the board holding me back even though it's almost certainly not the case.   Is this common?

Am I being silly in buying this board?  Will surfing it be vastly different or much of a muchness?

there are times where i've kept low all the way to the lip and the expanded and kept speed through the top turn but i'm still mostly just speeding / pumping up and down.

i guess the best ""feeling"" i've gotten so far is that i should go into the top turn with enough speed that i might come off the wave (which would even be a ""win"").  i might be getting too far outside the break instinctively on bigger waves to ""stay safe"", but instead should be angling closer to the break with more speed.  obviously every wave and situation is different.  i'm assuming people get what i'm saying.

More detail: earlier this year I was riding boards around 28L but have recently dropped liters and feeling more maneuverability. I buy 2nd hand boards as I seem to progress to smaller boards every few months. My current favorite is a [Dalton Jett](https://lostsurfboards.co.nz/fun-boards) (5'7 x 19 x 2.2 and 25.8L) twin plus trailer that felt great from the first wave. It seems to work well in the often soft beach breaks of Mount Maunganui (New Zealand)  but also felt great at the point break in Raglan on a head high day. With this board I am catching waves easily and it feels very stable for pop up. It's fast and locks into the face when needed, like taking a deep drop and getting down the line. But it's also easy to turn when I want to. I'm still developing my cutbacks and hacks and feel like this board will allow me to work on those with confidence.

I've been frequently riding twins (sometimes with trailer, sometimes not) the last 1.5 years but I'm wondering if a thruster would help my progression more, maybe more predictable through turns? With twins I sometimes don't know how hard to drive with the back foot, catching a rail if I push too hard. So I've had my eye out for thrusters and recently found an Inferno 72 (5'9 x 18 3/4 x 2 3/8 and 26.4L). I haven't quite gelled with this board. It feels a bit shaky when popping up, I expect because it is the narrowest board I've ridden. I could probably get used to this though it also feels difficult to turn once on my feet. Maybe this is bad technique. But with the Jett responding like I want, I wonder if the Inferno is too long or too big for me. Perhaps a 5'7 or 5'8 in this model would be better.

The Jett is working great so I'm thrilled to have that. It's meant for 1-5ft waves and does seem to excel in that size and can go if it's soft. I'd love to find a thruster to experiment with on bigger/hollower waves in the 2-8ft range. Should I be looking more at 24 liters for my weight?

I'd love some thoughts on twins vs thrusters for progression and when is the right time to drop liters.",surfing

1695094220.0,Adult learner shortboard diary entry 0,"Tactical Brain-dump incoming...

31m 5'8 135lbs surfing 7'6 egg for 2 and a bit years, picked up a 6' Chilli rare bird hybrid shortboard at 32.5L and here's how it went.

&#x200B;

* Session 0 - fun but crowded 1-2ft conditions at local beach break. My aim was to become vaguely familiar with lying on and paddling on the board, I noticed just how specific the sweet spot for paddling is, having my chest a few cm either direction had the nose either sticking way up or bogging underwater.

&#x200B;

* Session 1 - Glassy 2-3ft at remote beach break. During this session I caught some really fun waves, the stand out was a wave where I kept a high line and powered along, noting that applying some pressure on my rear foot really acted like an accelerator in comparison to my 7'6 which feels a bit more steady. Surfed for 3 hours and my arms were really burning and weak toward the end of the session, it's been a long time since I really felt like that because my bigger board paddles easier.

&#x200B;

* Session 2 - Very low period 3-4ft messy waves with a large amount of refraction and warping on the surface. This session was a brutal wake up call for me because I struggled to maintain a good paddling position due to the unstable water surface. Also, the frequent walls of white water had me quite gassed from having to duckdive often, I think my technique is currently inefficient.

&#x200B;

* Session 3 (Today) - Again, very messy low period but bigger, maybe 4-5ft. It was a mistake to take  shortboard out, I knew the swell was building but I didn't anticipate it being as big as it was. A positive thing is that I had less trouble maintaining a good paddling position this time, and I had some effective duckdives under the larger waves which really felt amazing in comparison to doing turtle rolls on my 7'6.

A huge mistake I made during today's session is that once I made it out back, I immediately went for a wave instead of waiting to fully catch my breath, I was way over eager and I paid dearly for it; I was too deep and went over the falls and took a couple wave hold down, which ignited a small amount of panic in me, as I was already a bit out of breath. I called it after that and after noticing how far I'd drifted sideways along the beach.

Other things I've learnt so far..

* I'm not riding the wave much differently to how I would on my 7'6, aside from slightly sharper cutbacks. This possibly means I'm not at the required skill level to be on a shortboard yet, I'm not going as top to bottom as the board could potentially go, and I'm still not sure if the shortboard will help me learn to surf in a more vertical style.
* I did sacrifice some time spent actually riding waves so far, due to misjudging the amount of paddling required or being too far from the peak, where my 7'6 would normally catch waves easily.
* The extra amount of exertion required on the shortboard threw off my ability to calculate my comfort zone, the waves today were NOT bigger than I'm comfortable with, but my tiredness made the hold downs more scary.
* Shortboards are very fun!

1694983720.0,"Surfed an unfamiliar, localized break for the first time, caught waves, and didn't get in any fights.","Listen up, kooks. I wrote this awhile back but hesitated to post it.  Maybe now is the right time, so here‚Äôs a counter-narrative to all the toxic tales of localism that tend to trend here (especially lately). This story is all true.  Every single word of it.

Earlier this year, I surfed a very localized break for the first time, and I didn't get in any fights.  No one swore at me.  No one burned me.  No one slashed my tires or waxed my windshield.  Not only that, but I got some great fucking waves on a day when it was shitty almost everywhere else for miles around.  How'd I pull off such a miracle?   And, more importantly, how can you?  Well, youngbloods, let me tell you a tale...

I pulled up to the spot and everyone's truck was bigger than my ride, and they all seemed to know each other.  And everyone looked me over when I rolled up.  I said 'hi' and 'good morning' and 'whassup' to *everyone* that looked my direction.

A couple of guys were already in the water, but half a dozen or so were standing around the overlook gauging the conditions.  I ambled over and took a seat next to the oldest guy in the group, gave him a nod, and *kept my mouth shut.*  We just watched the ocean together.  And one by one, guys toddled off to suit up until it was just me and the old man.

We talked surf, discussed the water, and agreed that the waves were better there than anywhere else along the coast that day.  As if to confirm our observations, some bigger OH sets came through and produced a clean, meaty wall. Somehow the swell seemed to focus on this one spot, and the same wind that made other spots blown out was blowing sweetly offshore.  As he talked, I listened and watched how guys made it out to the lineup, where they positioned, who was getting rides, and which set waves seemed to hold up best.

Then, I took my time suiting up and made my way down to the beach.  No hurry, no rush.  The old guy was already there, and after a few stretches, we paddled out together.  And for the next 30 minutes, I didn't paddle for shit.  I sat wide, and I watched.  I got my bearings in the water and made mental notes of who caught what, where.

Eventually, a set swung wide and I was in perfect position.  I turned to go, but a guy inside of me (closer to the beach but further from the peak) was paddling too.  He had already gotten several waves, and I was in the priority position.  So what did I do?  I fucking backed off and let him have it.

It was a sick wave, and he made good work of it.  I felt a tinge of jealousy and, despite my fear that my entire session might look like that, I complimented him anyway when he made it back out to the lineup.  And the next wave that came?  No one hassled me for it.  The lineup watched as I stroked in and caught my best wave of the year.  And from that point on, I was in the rotation.

About an hour later, I missed one of the best outside set waves of the session.  A couple of guys sitting further inside missed it too *because of me.*  They thought I was gonna get it, so they backed off.  As I hung my head, I heard one of them yell something towards me, and I immediately thought, ""Fuck, here it comes.""  I raised my hands and apologized for wasting it.  He yelled again, ""No, I said *damn, you almost had it.* Don't worry, you'll get the next one!""

But I didn't get the next one.  In fact, I let a few go through to the other guys that had been waiting.  And *then* I caught another to finish out a great session.

**TLDR** \- **went to a localized break for the first time, didn't act like an entitled ass or an anti-social goon, respected others, apologized when I fucked up, had the right board and abilities for the conditions, and ended up having a great session with no drama**

What kooks often fail to realize is that every break or region has a different culture, and that not every lineup shares the same culture as their home break.  I‚Äôm a pretty average surfer but I‚Äôve gotten waves at some localized breaks even when I look nothing like the locals or might not even speak the language.

In most cases, there‚Äôs no big secret trick.  Do your abilities match the spot?  Are you on suitable equipment for the wave?  After that, it just requires spending a little time observing the scene, trying to make a human connection to others, and showing some humility and respect.

And, especially when you‚Äôre traveling, this includes when you‚Äôre outside of the water too.  Because there‚Äôs a good chance that you‚Äôve already made an impression in the community before you even paddle out.  Kooks will act rude to their server or their driver, or harass the local women, or just act loud and obnoxious, and then be surprised when they paddle out the next morning and catch shit from the locals in the lineup.  

Moral of the story? Sure, sometimes it won't matter what you do because some assholes are undoubtedly gonna be assholes no matter what.  But if you don‚Äôt just bust on to the scene like a self-centered dickhead, you can *probably* avoid aggro in the water 99% of the time.  Of course, YMMV.  ",surfing

I have been short boarding for almost 2 of those years mainly on a hand-me-down 5'10 Firewire Cymatic. I love the speed of the board but when it comes to snappy turns the feeling of a twitchy board is completely missing, plus my friends are hating on the soft turns haha. With that said what am I missing? Is the board too long and not HP enough? Or is this likely a skill issue?

1694976994.0,"Been surfing the same spot for 8+ years and finally ran into localism(Westport, Wa) and in need of a sanity check","So it‚Äôs a beautiful day at a not so frequented spot (lefts looked super fun)in Westport, Wa, I paddle out and sit in the lineup on the shoulder waiting my turn. As the sets roll in all i do is turn my board waiting to see if the dudes with priority don‚Äôt make it then I‚Äôd go in case they miss it. They make it and I‚Äôm just admiring other surfers having a good time. Well they all go, then I lineup, about to turn and go for a wave and they yell at me and then this dude goes off saying I was ‚Äúshoulder hopping‚Äù except I didn‚Äôt drop in on anyone and the guys that had priority went. I told him I let everyone go and then he started yelling at me telling me he owned the spot which I tell him ‚Äúno one owns the fucking ocean‚Äù which judging my his initial demeanor I shouldn‚Äôt have said that cause I knew he was already heated. This caused him to go over the edge and I finally decided juice wasn‚Äôt worth the squeeze and paddled out at a different spot.

My question is was I in the wrong by chilling on the shoulder waiting my turn and then turning my board getting ready to go if they didn‚Äôt make it? I‚Äôve done that at plenty of other spots (Hawaii, Bali, Costa Rica, PNW) with no issue. Also I just wanted to vent

I bought the RRIPS Fins so could fiddle around with the placement as designed, and tend to run it as a quad.
My general understanding is that if I pull all the fins back, it will give a little more hold and draw out turns, whereas further forward fins loosen the board up a bit.

The question is what if you moved the front fins up but pulled the rear fins back? Or vice versa? So you played with the separation between the quad set up itself? I don‚Äôt really have a solid enough understanding of water physics to grasp how that might potentially change the ride!

Ultimately I‚Äôm just gonna try and play with it all, but I‚Äôd love some surfing bro science to unpack these wacky fin boxes!",surfing

Between a 6', 6'2, 6'4 and 6'6, what size Booby Quad would serve me best as a One Board Quiver?  I have intentions of developing my skills further, so I'd like the board to have enough foam to allow me to get into waves easily while my paddle strength is still lacking, though I'd like there to be room for it to remain a fun board for me as I further my capabilities and experience.

Without any guidance, I'm leaning towards the 6'6 with 47L of buoyancy just because all of my experience to date has been with high volume foam boards.  Is there any downside to the larger/thicker board?  My main desire of purpose for this board is to be a daily rider and allow me to move from beginner to intermediate!

Thankfully, I managed to get back to the shore on my own. After the incident, I wanted to familiarize myself with the SOS feature on my watch for future reference. To my surprise, my Garmin watch doesn't seem to have this capability.

  
This was a valuable learning experience for me. I'd like to ask the community: What should one do if caught in a similar situation in the future? What's the best strategy if you're being pulled further out to sea? Additionally, are there any reliable SOS devices designed for such situations that you would recommend?",surfing
1694705714.0,Multiple Shoulder dislocations (latarjet surgery),"What‚Äôs up friends! I have read through all the different posts about this topic and still felt the need to post. I want to start off saying I cannot express how much I appreciate the internet for things like this, and any comments are GREATLY appreciated :)

Since I was 15 (I am 26 now) I have had reoccurring dislocations with my left shoulder. Obviously as a kid I didn‚Äôt PT like I should have (I also wish someone would have forced me into surgery maybe?) but regardless I have once again ended up back in a position where I am afraid to move my body. 

For the past three months I‚Äôve diligently performed a program called ‚ÄúBullet Proof Shoulders‚Äù from an awesome dude named Trevor Hash. It has tons of animal movements and hanging exercises that had my shoulder feeling the best it‚Äôs ever been since the first dislocation. I unfortunately did a pec stretch incorrectly and boom there it went again.

I now am confident I want to try surgery even tho I will probably be paying it off for the rest of my life (but who cares if it fixes my problem?) I am insanely diligent with PT and very conscious about good posture and muscle recruitment. This injury has taught me so much, and if I can get my shoulder to the point of pushing through pain after surgery doing PT for a working shoulder I will fu$&ing do it 100000X over.

So please share your experience with latarjet surgery or anything similar. 

Thanks again :) -Zach",surfing
1694714970.0,Too fat? Too Slow? Positioing? Behind on Waves,"Trying to figure out what might be driving some of my recent NorCal ""performance issues.""  Been surfing a few times (2-3x) a week.  When waves get bigger and faster (say head high+), I find myself falling behind sections particularly after bottom turn.  I've noticed that on about half of my waves, when I'm making my bottom turn the wave is already crashing in front of me, and I have to straighten out or jump over the breaking wave.

My main suspicion is that I'm getting into the wave too late and maybe my pop up is a bit slower than it needs to be.  I can work on my pop up, but I still think that the late element might be something else.

Why might I be too late? I think it's because I'm a heavier guy.  I weigh 210+ (I'm 6'1), and due to NorCal currents/power, I find that I need more foam (average volume is 39-42L).  I've gone down in foam size (34L-36L), but paddling gasses me.  

My hypothesis is that because I have more foam, and because I'm heavier, I need to be deeper in the pocket and catch waves later.  I find that a lot of times I get sucked up the wave (from more foam) and while I can eventually paddle/drop in, it's nearly always critical.  I've seen many times guys smaller than me, positioned more on the shoulder and STILL getting into the wave before I would ever dream of.

Am I that weak?  Will losing weight help with this?  Am I just popping up too slow here?  Having a bigger board helps for sure (I get in nice and early with my log), but going much larger has it's own drawbacks (duck diving, control, steep faces, etc.)

Just wondering if anyone else whos on the heavier side has witnessed this, and how they were able to adjust accordingly.

I would say I'm an advanced beginner, been surfing for almost 1 year, can catch most waves, ride down the line on the face, still no bottom/top turns yet.

I've been surfing on a 7'0 (49L) but I've been struggling this summer on smaller days to catch waves consistently (most likely because of positioning and inefficient paddling I reckon)  but I really want to maximize fun, so was thinking to get a bigger board for those days.

Would something like this ([TORQ FUN V+ 7'8 (64L)](https://freewavesurfacademy.co.uk/shop/torq-mod-fun-78-v/)) worth it to get on top of my other mid or will it be redundant and I won't feel much difference?

1694537496.0,Hood attached or not,"I am looking to buy my first 5/4 wetsuit for winter. I have heard differing opinions about buying one with an attached hood or using a separate hood. 


Some people say attached hood is better because it is all in one and just feels warmer and kore protected.

But others have said having the suit with the attached hood increases risk of water leakage at the neck/shoulder area. 

Maybe both options are equally good ? Please let me know what you think",surfing
1694474007.0,What's stinging me in the water?,"Recently while surfing in Florida, every time I go out I've been getting little stinging spots all over my body while I'm in the water. I can't see anything in the water that would do this unless it's some magical seaweed lol, I don't know if it's some sort of tiny invisible jellyfish thing or what but I genuinely can't figure out what's stinging me. Anybody know what could be the cause of this? Any sort of tiny organism thing?",surfing
1694487994.0,Article on Surflies in The Atlantic,"[Thinkpiece](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/surfline-webcams-surfing-community-gripes/675287/) on Surfline in the everyman's version of the New Yorker.

Think this neglects the fact that a bunch of folks dislike Surfline because a shit ton of (beginner/""intermediate"") surfers take the color rankings at face value. Here in California I swear folks would see a dark green or purple day with a swell straight out of the northeast and they'd STILL go to the beach, cam or not. I think Surfline makes a lot of surfers less thoughtful and curious about the ocean and the surf in many respects. Some of the best days are when it says poor to fair!",surfing
1694555672.0,The M.O.A.R. rack. (Mother of all racks),"For those that live far from surf, like to do all of the things when you are on the road, and run a truck camper because you can't afford #vanlife here is a solution for you. In spring or fall in the PNW it's not unrealistic to do these 3 sports on a single short trip (an obvious application would be squamish/north shore riding, whistler skiing, and tofino surfing). But makes sense in Washington Oregon and California as well when it's not on fire. 

This is a velocirax 6 bike carrier with the central 2 slots removed. Initially I just used a block surf strap system centrally but dealing with the straps was annoying. Totally works though if you are in a budget. Verified for over a few thousand miles of rough driving.  Today I installed the Inno racks Inna446 which is a ratcheting locking rack for boards. I had to get creative with extra long bolts since it was designed for factory crossbars on suvs, but after making some shims and other creative liberties it turned out excellent and currently still accommodates 4 bikes. 

In fall velocirax is releasing their ski attachment which will allow me to have 2 bikes on one side, 3 boards centrally, and skis on the other side with all of it locked except for the skis. 

I add a ratchet strap over to minimize the slight movement of the rack when on rough roads or long trips. 

I've used it on boards up to 9'6. The camper blocks 90+ percent of the wind, and boards loaded bottom towards the rack makes the wind push right over the rocker of long boards. For ease of loading sometimes I put a wood board just strapped to the base of my velocirax as a platform for ease of one person loading.",surfing

There is no place for a surf leash, only a small eyelet near the back of the middle fin. I was told I could use that to somehow attach a leash, but I don't know if that's true. Any advice would be appreciated!",surfing

1694558839.0,Is it really so hard to stand on a proper surfboard on the water even with it being a heavy device?,"Me and my friends decided to make a bet at the swimming pool. We got the lifeguard's float and started trying to stand atop of it. One fell into the water, Another was able to stand but needed help from us to get off.  In my turn I didn't fall but I was scard as hell and  felt like I was about tl  slip and land my head on the concrete floor of the pool deck and the only reason I didn't fall and was able to get off safely was because I held the rails or  a nearby ladder.  One  of my pals saw how hard we were having staying atop the float that he decided to chicken out of the dare.

So this makes me wonder would staying stop a surfboard be pretty difficult? Would the weight not provide any stability to make it easier than our recent stunt that was provoked by a dare by one of us?",surfing

I wear sunscreen before I head out, is there any way to prevent this other than not wearing the surf hat? would a bucket hat type help more?

so far I have just been rocking this awkward tan look but would rather not!
