1643106953.0,How to escape from Teaching to Tech: an easy guide,"##Why?

- High employment
- Huge salaries
- Really not so hard
- Often can work remote
- Your boss HAVE TO make you happy because you can just quit

##Which industry?

- Video games, software development, webdev...
- Webdev currently a very good choice, lots of demand, good work condition, high salaries. I only know webdev, so I will talk here about webdev.

##Is it easy?

Nothing worth doing is really easy. It is a LOT of work, because there are a **lot** of things to learn. It can be a very pleasant experience depending on your situation and interests, or it can be not for you at all.

This article will try to list everything that can help you or impede you. If you have a lot of positive points, you should definitely do it. If you don't, then maybe not.

##Which skills are needed?

- Passion for programming: huge advantage, but not mandatory.
- Ability to sit in front of a screen for long times (or stand, you WILL invest in a standing desk eventually)
- Talent: Some people learn faster than others. Some people start with an affinity for computer logic. You don't need talent to succeed, but talent will help you achieve your goals faster.

##Can anyone do it?

- Some people can't learn programming at a decent pace.
- Most people can succeed in a couple years.
- Some people can succeed in a very short time (6 months to a year)

Teachers are often bright people, so most of you should be in 2nd or even 3rd category.

ADHD/Autistic people usually succeed very well from what I've seen (conditions apply).

Note: these estimations are assuming you are in the ""unemployed"" category. If you work full-time on the side, it can be much longer.

##Personal advantages:

- You have a network of programmers around you (friends, family)
- Non-native English speakers: you speak English fluently

##Personal disadvantages:

- You have kids. It's already a lot of work, a lot of pressure, and a lot of interruptions while you study. Still possible, but it makes it harder.

##How to learn?

- Self-taught works: online MOOCs and courses.
- Paid bootcamps: Sometimes bad. Sometimes very expensive. Sometimes great. Need to check what they're teaching, ""real"" reviews from alumni, etc.
- 42 free coding school: In Paris and Silicon valley (maybe other places). I recommend it if you can get past the entrance exam. Don't need to finish the full 3-years, you can leave after one.

Other considerations: You need to work on Unix for most technologies, so either install Linux, or if you have too much money and you don't hate apple then buy a mac.

Additionally, you should balance your time between practicing and learning. Practicing should go first, until you're blocked, then it's time to learn. Once you know enough to unblock you, go back to practicing.

##What to learn?

Full guides here: [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/)
Frontend is a good choice for starters and a good entry to the job. You can also aim to enter as backend or fullstack, but you need some frontend knowledge anyway.

The guides are a good resource, but you should also check where you live/where you WANT to live and see what's the most sought after there.

##When to learn?

- While working on the side (so on evenings, weekends): Difficult, but might be doable. Might take a much longer time.
- Quitting your job to study: Much easier, but you need to be able to support yourself financially.

##Timeline for self-taught webdev

To learn a new technology, you usually start with lessons and short exercises (i.e on [websites like this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)). Then I would advise to build a decent-size project to really be sure you're past tutorial hell (see below). This project should take at least a couple week of full-time work.

Then keep learning highly researched new technologies. When you know ""enough"", start looking for a job. ""Enough"" might be HTML/CSS/Javascript + React + other stuff like Git (see guides).

While you're actively looking for a job, keep working on personal projects.

Finally, know that ""writing working code"" is not enough, you need to produce Enterprise-grade code. Read about ""Best practices"". Try to find a mentor to guide you on this vast topic.

##What are the biggest challenges?

- Tutorial hell: when you are able to do ""coding exercises"", very small projects, small web pages, but are unable to start a real project which scales in complexity. No easy solution for this except practice, practice, practice.

- First job: The first job is the hardest to get. The reason is that rookie developers actually cost more to a company than they bring, and once they start working efficiently they often leave for a better job. So companies have little incentive to hire you out fresh out of school.

Once you are past 2 years experience as a developer, [you are worth more than money](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/companies-worry-more-about-access-to-software-developers-than-capital.html) and will never be hungry again.

I have known three. One teacher was arrested for sexual misconduct with a former student. Another teacher was arrested for having multiple DUIs, and it was published in the local paper. Another teacher was fired because they were caught stealing at a department store and were arrested.

I have also known many more teachers, who have done the same, or worse, and have never been caught. They keep their jobs or even get promoted.

1697257011.0,My age is impacting my authority?,"Hello! I’m a 20yr old female dance teacher who is having trouble garnering respect from my students, fellow dancers, and some fellow teachers. For some context my fellow dancers are around high school age and my students range from 3-10yrs old. I also happen to default to saying “yes” when it comes to helping others in my free time, I am diagnosed with autism (the faculty are aware) and I have taught in a public school and in a ballet company. 

I believe that my age is impacting my authority because a parent of a student who was acting out in class said that I looked like a, “big sister” instead of a teacher. I have also been talked down to by the high school dancers because I am supposedly too old to be allowed to sit somewhere even if I got there first or I have seniority in the company. However, these same dancers would make way for other dancers my age with the same skills if they happen to guest for our company. I was also kinda forced to massage one of the senior eachers because I was not busy. They did not stop to ask if I was ok with it. 

I have been in therapy and am now learning that people can take advantage of you, but I want to develop authority at least equal to my position in the school. I have been working on declining things that I am not interested in doing, but I still have trouble with saying “no” in the moment. Is there any way to change my reputation at my school? It’s pretty abysmal right now, but I would like to change how people treat me for the better. This is the only dance school near where I live that also puts on major productions where I have met wonderful guest artists, so I do want to stay.",TeacherReality

In other classes I can see who is doing it and they get a weeks detention. These kids wait for me to turn my back , or try and help another student, even when I am looking I can't always tell who is doing it- so I can't levy the consequence.

 I asked my admin for help, but they basically wrote back how I hadn't improved my classroom management in years, so I need more in depth observation - and that 8th grade shouldn't be given art supplies and just learn art history. I didn't give them any supplies today and pencils still got thrown. I am out of my wits end - any ideas would be so appreciated.",TeacherReality

We have a teacher who is a tattle tale on our team, and it’s the worst. She tattle tales on everyone on our team/hallway for the smallest things. 

- I wore colored jeans (they were forest green)and a cute top on a non-Jean day. She reported me.

- I sometimes get away with wearing yoga tights to school if I wear them under a dress in the winter. She reported me.

-In Texas, we are required to lock and keep all of our doors closed all the time, but I had to prop it open for 30 seconds when I was wheeling in my full sized harp (it’s 90 pounds and 6 feet tall). She reported me. So when it happened again I had a student hold open the door instead. She also reported me

- The fire Marshall doesn’t let us keep things on our doors, but I once put a sticky note on my door to let people know that I was taking my students outside. She reported me.

- A student put an empty water bottle in the trash can instead of the recycle bin. She reported me.

-My students bet me that I couldn’t do 5 cartwheels in a row, so I did it in the hallway. She sure as hell reported me.

-We aren’t allowed to eat in front of the students. I had a breath mint. AND SHE REPORTED ME.

1695876265.0,Tonight I was scolded by a parent for telling their kid to quiet down.,"I am a high school music teacher who often takes students to events after school. Tonight we were on a bus and the students were very exuberant,  talking and laughing loudly.  One girl in particular had a very high pitched -ear piercing laugh which was bothering our bus driver who asked her to stop. The kids ignored the bus driver, so I stepped in calling the girl’s name and asked her to quiet down. (Loudly in order to be heard over the commotion)

As parents often come to these events, the parent s of the loud girl approached me very upset that I had yelled at their child in front of a bus full of students which embarrassed her. They also felt the need to explain to me that their daughter has a loud voice and I should understand that she can’t control it. 

So, I’m not supposed to control a situation where a child’s high pitched laugh is distracting a bus  driver in fear that I might embarrass the kid? How does this make sense? 

I guess I’m just venting because I’m so annoyed at these parents. Thanks for listening!",TeacherReality

I work for a Montessori school for preschoolers as an assistant and have been there for almost a year. We have a very high turnover rate for assistants cause we were always understaffed and people leave constantly. I’ve given my 2 week notice and was asked to stay one more week as we have some staff that are out for vacation. I ended up agreeing cause I felt bad and wanted to show how dedicated I am even if I’m leaving. Side note, I personally feel like the parents trust me more than the newer assistants since I’ve been there longer than then. So some parents I feel like are comfortable talking to me about their child’s day or progress. The other day I was called by my assistant director and director to the office, saying that a parent “complained” that I made their child seem like they are terrible or bad… and a couple days before I was talking to that same parent informing her that I’ll be leaving and of course she was saying that it’s sad for them to see me go. I also was telling her that I will miss working with her kid since her kid is in preschool and I was assigned for toddlers that week I am originally for preschool and hated that they’ve put me in toddlers since I’ve never worked with toddlers on top of that I told them that I would like to keep my 9-5 schedule and I have communicated to them long time ago that I prefer not to close but still they’ve put me on a closing shift. She made a sly comment saying “ugh I wouldn’t want to be in toddlers, I think I can be with infants” since I felt like we were in a joking kind of conversation I responded to her jokingly “don’t be fooled”(about the infants) apparently the same parent mentioned this to my director and was pretty much told by my director and asst. director to avoid parents at all costs and to shut up and just be very positive. side not our previous lead teacher called cps and licensing on this place. There are so much other dramas that went on but it’s too long to add here.Now I feel awful since all I just care about their child but don’t meant anything by it. But I dislike working at this place and I’m really unhappy which is why I’m leaving. I’m so traumatized after I was called into the office for this reason. I feel even worse that I’m on my last week and I feel so attacked. This place has caused me so much anxiety all throughout my stay. I guess my unhappiness is reflecting on the way I communicate?  I’m really sad about this whole thing and I feel like I cannot show my face to them anymore. Also cause I feel so betrayed and that they don’t have my back after all the crappy ways they’ve treated me. I don’t know what to feel and think anymore.

Some schools do an excellent job with mentoring and supporting new teachers. Some schools are best for veteran teachers on the verge of burnout. During my first few years, I hopped around a bit: I taught in a small CA Catholic middle school, a rural Virginia middle school, a small CA private secular K-8 school. Then I moved to NYC and I taught at a large Title 1 high school NYC closed down, a new small Title 1 grades 6-12 NYC public school (aftermath of the closing down) for 9 years. I then moved South and taught in Maryland at two charter schools, one located in DC. I then took a job at a very large (academically) high performing suburban Maryland high school. All have their strengths and weaknesses, upsides and downsides. If you are someone who craves meaning and seeing a relatively immediate positive impact on others as I do, I advise frustrated teachers to try a variety of settings and, if you can, and move when things get stale before giving up on the profession completely. Also, don't be afraid to switch subjects. I taught math at the private schools, got bored, and then got certified in English. Middle school kids were driving me crazy so I picked up an ESOL license through Praxis, allowing me to teach any grade. Later I did the same with social studies. This helped me get away from the massive amounts of grading. Happy now although I sometimes miss my colleagues and the family-like environment from the high pressure Title 1 schools.

1690122208.0,I got a write up during the summer for having anxiety,"So, it seems I need a new way to share my vents, my frustrations, my joys just all of it.  So, let me give a little back story.  Last year at the end of the year we learned that we had 3 APs leaving, one being my evaluator and the other two being over scheduling along with our director of Special Education who I bonded with this year as a first-time small group teacher.  This mean that for the first time since I've been working at this school I left with no clue of what I might be teaching next year and absolutely no idea as to who I'll be working with in my direct chain of command.  

A friend of mine put up a post about all the changes he wants to make to improve himself and his school year this year.  I commented telling them I was anxious because of the information above.  That's when I learned a few things.  1) They have a teacher rat on their FB.  2) My fears about this principal which had been subsided after their being here for two years were actually founded. 3) Having anxiety is a negative reflection of the school and a violation of social media policy (WTF!!!!).

So, obviously someone had to tell the principal what I commented because per social media policy both our accounts are friends only and the principal isn't a friend on either account.  So, I get a call from the principal berating me for having anxiety about the year.  Accusing me of being ungrateful because they had fended off issues and defended me as a teacher last year (um as long as I'm not doing anything wrong isn't that their job?).  The icing on the cake though was their telling me that if I have anxiety, I should be going to a therapist to fix my problems not sharing them with coworkers because they can't be on any assistance to my mental health.",TeacherReality

1689345909.0,Seals clapping along to their own undoing,"OK. I work in a school in the UK. 

Everyone is stressed, off sick, injured from pupil assault. Ya know. Normal. 

Workload has been ratcheted up constantly because the school appointed some middle leaders from the money they don't seem to have. They need to justify their position so they've been making paperwork exercises. 

Teachers. Classic teachers. Fucking teachers. 

Meeting starts. We are told we will be creating a 900/1000 word planning document every half term based off *planning that is already online*. Yes. So we're going to copy and paste the content into a document, add some word soup and promises of differentiation that will probably not happen. 

Teachers all nodding. The same teachers who complain about workload and understand there's no time for this. I'm looking around wondering if they've done the translation yet. It roughly translates to 

""hey fuckers, you know that holiday you get to try and rebuild your shattered mental health?... how about we take another day of it off you... because this pointless fucking document HAS to be on the system by 9am on the first day. Not for students. For us""

No one says anything. The cat flap in an elephant house effectiveness senior leaders grin mindlessly knowing more work is being done. That must be good right? Do they wonder how much more work can be ratcheted up? No. Because that would require an understanding of management beyond unrealistic ungrounded mindless aspirations based on falsity.

1686837821.0,Career Advice,"Hi All, 

I work for a large urban district. We are surrounded by smaller suburban districts that do pay significantly more money (with less education requirements for top salaries). Here’s the catch: my district pays significantly more from years 1-10, it’s only after that point where the suburban districts leave my district in their dust.

For example, with a master’s plus 60 credits (or three master’s degrees, or one doctorate), my district’s top base salary is $105k after ten years. A suburban district will pay a base of $125k after 15 years with only a master’s plus 30 credits.

My salary is increasing by $6k starting this summer, but if I went to this suburban district at the equivalent salary step, my income would basically be the same as it was this year. 

So what would you do? Take a pay cut for a decade to reap the higher salary for the second half of your career, or decrease your total career’s earnings by about $300k and stay in the current district?

Thanks!",TeacherReality
1686712632.0,Blackout protest,"So... Elephant in the room: Why hasn't
r/TeacherReality joined the Reddit protest when so many adjacent subs have? The mod team hasn't spoken about it, so this is just me talking. But there is stuff worth saying.

First and foremost reason, in my mind, is that the community has not called for it. The first meta thread about the protest on the sub was posted today. If/when the community calls for action, the community will decide and we moderators will follow. What ""decided"" looks like in a site filled with bots and alts is a bit hard to nail down, but the decision rests with the community, not its moderators.

Second, I mod a few subs, one of which has joined the protests (the others are too small for it to be much impact either way). I would say that the purpose of *that* sub is entertainment, which is not the reason *this* sub exists. 

Our primary purpose is to offer a place for teachers to receive support in the tough choice many make to leave the profession. Summer is the time when many make that choice. When someone leaves their school, they may be leaving their support system, their friends, and reevaluating much about their life. This is a place to remind them that they still have value (both economic and *human* value). I don't want to shut down that life line just when someone might need it.

I've been teaching for 19 years-- I'm going to keep teaching-- but I've seen too many colleagues and friends broken, by what was the toughest choice they ever faced, for me to pull the rug out from under anyone who needs the help-- even for a moment. There are school admins, HR departments, and even colleagues out there who will make people feel like their humanity and wellbeing is a small price to pay for test scores-- we are a counter narrative to that.

Does that excuse anything Reddit is doing? No. I am personally horrified, especially by the shutdown of apps that provide accessibility where Reddit does not. 

If the sub decided that it was time to go dark, would I press the button? Sure. 

Is that my decision to make? I don't think so.

Any feedback is appreciated.",TeacherReality

He is extremely supportive of teachers, he is also certified in ELA and Math and will happily take over a class if needed. He LOVES confrontation (meaning, get an angry parent to calm down), coaches several sports and the students love him. He is the first one in the school and the last one out. This man is so dedicated, a great leader, teacher and colleague. 

Our school has two campuses. The other one is a huge mess and all the middle school teachers threaten to walk out. My principal was asked to intervene and help for a few weeks. And I guess their principal is now gone. 

HR decided to move him to that campus. I am pretty sure he is not happy about that. I know he loves his school and he complained about the other campus a lot. They didn't give him a choice. 

We do not know what the board is going to decide as to who is going to be our principal.

We had a standing meeting last Monday to learn that over the weekend one of our students parents called the police because he found a pistol and AR in the kids bedroom. Upon further investigation admin found out there was a TikTok of this kid showing his buddy the guns in the school bathroom the week before. The day this kid brought them to school he was supposed within the first 32 minutes for flipping off a teacher. Based on his history we believe he intended to use them.

What did admin do? Sent out communication to parents 3 days after telling staff about it but said ""weapon"" even though we clearly knew it was a gun. Also, this situation could have been completely avoided because the kid sold pot gummies on campus the second week of school. He should have been charged with a felony and expelled then. No, we let him stay and be spent 27% of his year causing enough issues to be suspended. The kid that took the video in the bathroom for him? I found his TikTok and he's also a little prick. He thinks he's so tough and cool, his parents also bought him a shotgun for his birthday. Yet another kid that should've been expelled long ago for constant suspensions.

We have 1.5 days left and I feel like every day I go home I'm just thankful to still be alive. This whole event sends the message of: ""we don't care about your safety as long as these kids learn"". I signed a contract in a new district for next year and cannot wait to be out.",TeacherReality
1684463829.0,Positive Reinforcement?,"Positive Reinforcement.

How can you use positive reinforcement on a child who is received many warnings about being mindful about their body and surroundings but still constantly get hurt.  It has been going for 3 weeks.

I got so frustrated that I let the child know that I am scared to take them on summer field trips. If there is a 4th week I will put my foot down and ask one of their parents to go with. But ik for a fact they won't bother to come. They NEVER have.

ANYWAYS

No shock today and with my luck they went home and had a limp but didn't tell staff. And I get a message from mom along with my much now regretted statement of "" I'm scared to take them on field trips."" (Let mom know it was regrettably mentioned)

 I've already noted and know that they get overly excited before the transition to outside or new activites. I ask them to walk to the ""calm couch"" and to show me what relaxed and clam means. (If they are not running they are stomping and angry/screams because I am asking them to relax & calm down and even then the success rate is maybe 65%)
But this morning and my luck, they run to the couch and adds in a head into the wall. 

How do you turn running into the wall a positive reinforcement situation even after many warnings and told what behavior is to be expected? (*** please walk to the calm couch and relax) I've done my part to see what triggers cause these actions but its following through directions and listening isn't going though. 

Maybe I say and do ""I see that you ran into the wall, that's why the direction was to walk. Here is a hug,ice pack and an hour me panic observing to make sure you don't have a concussion"" 

Where do I add the ""rewarding or reinforcing desirable behavior in order to increase the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated in the future""?(google)

SO 

In my response, I told her ""How does after a couple of reminders to *** about being mindful of how our surroundings can affect our body or the choices that we make can affect our body. We can have *** sit next to a teacher for a calm break until *** is ready to try again."" 
 But it's still the same strategy I have used just different places and clearly it's not positive enough. Obviously reminders only can go so far. 


As for ""how is his body awareness"" he walks around and says genitalia terms like its nothing. (Not often and is corrected and told when is and where is the appropriate time to say those terms) He's well aware of what IS where and whats IS there. IM SURE he is aware of his body.",TeacherReality

Yesterday, my district received mass threats to middle schools throughout the district. Parents were advised to speak with their children and student absences were all excused. Here’s where i’m fucking pissed:

We, as their teachers, were not given ANY information. We were not told which schools received a threat (it’s a big district) and we were not told exactly what the threat entailed. We were also NOT encouraged to stay home like students were. they didn’t acknowledge us at all, actually. I was literally sobbing this morning on my way to work because I was so terrified. I said goodbye to my husband, my cats, my best friend and parents, hell I even drafted a goodbye note for my best friend to give my husband “just in case”!!!

Maybe it was stupid of me to not call out immediately, but we live in such a society where I feel BAD for wanting to protect MY OWN LIFE over the lives of other peoples kids that I have no relation to. Don’t get me wrong, I adore my students but I JUST got married. I JUST turned 25 (literally yesterday, got the email at my literal birthday dinner so that was fun /s) I have had unrelated health issues recently that has caused me to miss multiple days so close to the end of this school year and i felt bad calling out when I “didn’t need to” 

My roommate woke up to see me walking out the door sobbing my eyes out and so I told them what was going on and why I was still going in. How I didn’t know which schools were under threat and it was a small chance it was my school since the district was so big so “it will probably be fine” They told me to text my principal and ask if she had more info (this hadn’t even occurred to me, idk why) and she responded that it was in fact our school that was directly under threat. I told her immediately that I was staying home which thankfully she understood and wasn’t upset at all. 

It just PISSED me off that we as teachers got NO INFORMATION. There was nothing communicated that we were under investigation or called out. I had to ASK. Why didn’t they just close the school down?!? I spent the entire day stressed out of my mind and looking at the news every hour to see if there were any updates. We ended up getting a district wide email saying that the poster was arrested and would be charged accordingly, and thank fucking god that nothing happened but what the hell has america come to?! I shouldn’t have to go to work teaching CHILDREN afraid for my fucking life and saying goodbye to my husband and family! I’m beyond pissed off.",TeacherReality

1677549397.0,"Here's My Experience: I have no one to tell, so I'll tell you.","I need to express what I'm going through somewhere, and this seems like an okay place to do it. I often see people posting here in a rather negative way about students, but to be honest I don't find the students to be what makes this a punishing job. I became a teacher through TFA, so I have only worked in Title I schools. Fights break out, property gets damaged, and students can be generally noisy, mean, and way less mature than society expects, but I find that the way I treat students has a huge influence on how they respond to me. I have noticed at the schools I have worked at that the teachers most likely to complain about how horrible students are happen to be teachers that are mean and sometimes say dehumanizing things to students. They also happen to be teachers who are pretty ""old school"", and don't feel like its worth their time to bother keeping up with best practices in the field.

In short, I'm pretty new at this but student behavior is not something I prioritize as a problem. It may be that I came into teaching as what TFA calls a ""career changer"", and I am bringing my previous experience with me, which has happened to be pretty helpful in the classroom.

What makes this job such a demoralizing and demeaning experience is the school district... well, the system in general. There is just too much about how education works that honestly just seems like a stupid idea. What feels good to say is that the district seems like it's run by idiots.

When I started writing this post, I expected that I would be able to explain some of why I believe this. But now I'm running out of time to write, and I don't even know where to start because it's so overwhelming. I have worked in about two dozen organizations and I have never seen anything approach the level of incompetence and dysfunction that I am observing in this school district, full of people none-the-wiser going about their business as if this stuff was normal.

There are lots of valid criticisms about Teach For America, but one thing that they seem to do well is to expose incoming teachers to the most current practices in teaching, and give you a pretty formidable crash course on theory. One would think that a summer crash course on literacy education and pedagogy is but a humble beginning compared to the experience of education leaders who have a decade or more under the belt. This is what I believed. 

I shit you not, I have come to the slow awareness over my time teaching that the TFA crash course plus my previous work experience and unrelated degree have left me more prepared to do this right off the bat than a lot of people seem like they are after years. I do not feel proud of myself and am not bragging about this. Rather, it's the story of a slow horror that has been making itself known to me. Like, really? How is it that I have a better idea of how to do this than the people whose jobs are allegedly to tell me how to teach?

I have educators in my life that are inspiring, and I admire some public leaders in education as well. Of all the people who have a say over what I am doing (there are about seven *seven* ***SEVEN PEOPLE*** observing my classroom and leaving orders for me---no wait... EIGHT) one. *one.* **ONE OF THEM** is a person who obviously has good leadership skills, builds relationships with students and teachers skillfully, is extremely knowledgeable about teaching practices AND gives amazing feedback. ONE OF THEM, and it's the one that gets bulldozed the most by the others because this person is at the bottom of their hierarchy.

Could be worse. I trust my administrators' intentions and I like them. I've been disappointed by some of their decisions---I don't know what makes them think that asking me to explain my lessons over and over is a more helpful use of time than letting me reflect and come to our coach for feedback (coach with specific and recent experience in my subject area, or admin without experience in this core subject... which is more helpful?), or what makes them think that scolding me (""you better do it!"") is a good way to get the results they want from me when I am a grown-ass adult who is clearly intrinsically motivated to grow in this role. Actually, does anyone really need to be harassed into doing this job? Is it even possible? Who is even left teaching besides people who are stuck waiting for retirement and people who have some good personal reasons to even try it? I think that when they feel harassed and infantilized by their bosses, they decide to just pass it on.

As far as admin are concerned, that job is absurdly hard and overwhelming, but administrators who don't learn to fully trust the people who are working under their authority are just going to make it harder for themselves. That's true in every organization. 

Why my administrators feel that way is because they themselves have to report to a micromanaging hierarchy of people who maybe aren't people's favorite to work with. One would imagine that being a psychopath and sadist is a prerequisite for work in that department. There are so many cooks in the kitchen... I mean, we could totally better use that money to hire coaches and ESE teachers, but my district instead decided to create an out-of-touch, pompous hierarchy. Instead of sending work down the hierarchy, there are FOUR levels of this hierarchy that directly engage with us at the classroom level. They don't say anything---they mostly seem to try to avoid interacting with teachers. But they have opinions. And this entire organization is run according to their opinions. Not policy, not a concrete and transparent set of criteria... just their often inconsistent opinions. So we are left scrambling at the bottom to meet their often different expectations, which are sometimes incompatible with each other.

Their opinions are the worst. They insist that we adopt these awfully lazy teaching practices that they think are good teaching. They think they are rigorous. Putting their ideas to work in my classroom only makes things worse. I did it because I was sure I'd collect data on how it's worse, and I do have some. But now no one is interested in looking at my data. lol.

I teach students in historically poor neighborhoods. The overwhelming majority are from recently immigrated families or African-American families. I have students that have extremely poor self-management skills, short attention spans, and I imagine are neurologically under-stimulated and under-developed. For these students, a lot of scaffolding is important. I cannot simply put a grade-level text and a bunch of multiple choice questions in front of them and hope for the best, or ask them to read independently and shrug if they fall behind. That only works if they value education and are intrinsically motivated themselves. If they don't... well god forbid they appear to have fun in class, or that I spend a necessary amount of time getting them to buy into what I'm teaching so that it actually sticks, or that I give them a little agency so that they are treated like human beings for a while and practice making decisions about their learning. This is exactly what all the relevant experts and sources that I trust say I need to do, but the bureaucracy of child-hating psychopaths is not into it. They have the fewest complaints when what I'm doing looks like test-prep, which let's be honest bores the shit out of me and you, so definitely bores the shit out of my struggling students.

Not all my students are far below grade level. Some of them are at or above grade level. At some of the more highly-regarded schools in my district, their mastery would probably be seen as mediocre. However, relative to other students at my school, these guys are doing their best to aim high. In this group of students, I have students who have unbelievably bad situations at home and have to struggle with difficult family conflicts. They are emotionally affected by these things. Some of them struggle to be motivated. They might be the first English-speaking generation in their family. There are so many students that are driven and gifted. They go through the year barely turning any work in, and then BOOM they turn in something that demonstrates an impressive level of insight and creativity, maybe because they happened to have a good week and were better able to rise to their potential. They would soar so high if we only took notice and helped them overcome the obstacles that are holding them back.

Being responsive to the needs of either of these groups of students, which both make up the majority of my students, is not an important part of teaching according to the useless wastes of public money that have the most influence over what happens to them. When I try to do something to be responsive to my students according to best practices that I can cite, I tend to get reprimanded, called ""outside of the box"" for playing it safe according to science, get called ""rogue"" for letting my relationship with my students and all the data I get from that inform my teaching.

I have never felt as disrespected, demeaned, demoralized as a professional. I have never worked for people so ignorant. Their incessant demands for compliance with their unclear and contradicting instructions (how do you comply successfully with something that contradicts itself, anyway?) are oppressive and just wrong. They are so short on teachers, but I don't think they got the memo on that because they treat us like we are expendable. I already have another career and I am testing the waters through a TFA commitment... why the hell would I want to actually continue working under these conditions? 

If someone paid me to organize AGAINST this bureaucracy of clowns and identify them as the enemy of the people that they are I would take that job.",TeacherReality

1676670729.0,I made my VP cry today,"TLDR: I brought an error to the VPs attention and she responded by not fixing it and crying. 


In my district to handle sub/teacher shortages, teachers cover for absent teachers during their prep periods. We are supposed to have a union negotiated equitable rotation of teachers covering. My school in particular is terrible at it. People on the “leadership” team (deans, counselors, coaches, the vice principal and the principal) and school darlings rarely if ever are covering. 

Recently I complained that the space I’m reaching out of (I am a special education teacher, the only one in my building without their own class room) is being misused and it has become super disruptive to my students.

Since then, I have been covering almost every day and had three prep periods I wasn’t covering during in the past two weeks. 

Yesterday morning when I saw I was covering again, I asked the VP (who as part of her duties is supposed to create these schedules) why I had another coverage as it doesn’t make sense given the rotation. She responded that because of call outs EVERYONE was being used. Looking at the coverage sheet, this was obviously untrue but I let it go because I had stuff to do and I’m not interested in arguing with her.

Today, I sat in my car waiting for the daily coverage schedule to come in through email before going in. When I got it and saw I had lost my prep period again, I checked and made sure there were other people on the same rotation as me available. I already knew from checking yesterday that they should have been ahead of me in the rotation. None of them were covering, none of them had scheduling conflicts. There was no obvious reason it should have been me again. 

So armed with all this, I walked into the building and attempted to talk to my vice principal. I am NOT a confrontational person, and honestly part of why I’m dealing with not having a classroom and being used for coverages so much is because I am a very easy going person at work(I’ve learned my lesson now though). 

So I calmly tell my vice principal “VP, I covered 2nd grade Tuesday, 8th grade yesterday and you have me on the schedule for Kindergarten today. There are other sped teachers who have not had coverages at all this week.” (I had the ok to mention this from these teachers because everyone is aware of this issue and I’ve had all their backs before) 

And my vice principal starts crying and says “I’m sick and I’m here! And principal has said she will pay someone else to make the coverage schedule because I don’t want to do it anymore!” 

She wasn’t yelling but was loud, everyone is looking at us, I didn’t want to lose my shit so I just turned around and walked out of the office. I heard she starting crying more after I left and said “all the sped teachers hate me”

The absolute insanity of this situation is too much. Imagine someone bringing an error you made to your attention and responding by crying and telling them your job is too hard? I still lost my prep. She hasn’t said anything to me since. I’ve interacted with the principal since then and other leadership people who were there and everything was fine.

Idk what I want to do from here. I did talk to my union rep about it, they said they would address it but i am seriously just mind blown by the whole situation.",TeacherReality

1674780133.0,Nobody told me that tattoos would a problem,"Edit: dress code was brought up extensively during my interview it was never mentionned, I asked the specific rules of dress code teachers. Yes, asking about tattoos didn't occur to me as I never had to cover them before, my parents are teachers and covered in tattoo, it didn't even cross my mind. I also had a 1h phone chat with HR prior to my hiring and we talked, again, about teacher dress code extensively, tattoos were still not brought up. I feel deceited. 

I just started a new position as an ELA teacher in a charter (secular) middle school. The position has been vacant for nearly 2 years. I am highly qualified and they absolutely love me, they were desperate to hire me and paid my buyout for leaving my previous school.

Today a colleague, who also has a lot of tattoos, told, very nicely, me to cover up my arm tattoo, that it was against school policy.

I was told about dress code, which is slightly stricter than what I am used to, but I have no issues with it. I talked to HR for weeks (it was hard to break my old contract) never the tattoos were mentioned, and I have tattoos on my fingers! Idk if they were completely oblivious to them...

Should I pretend I don't know the rule? Also if I am told to cover them, which is ridiculous, none of my tattoos are offensive, the finger ones are a moon and a sun, the arm one is our local skyline, and the ones that will become visible in the summer are flowers, should I really cover them?

I live in Southern AZ and in August it can be over 115 degrees, I absolutely cannot teach in long sleeves!! And I will probably start coaching soccer, outdoors. 

What are they going to do? Fire a good teacher they had trouble finding and leave the classroom empty until they find replacement again? I'm the only ELA teacher of the entire school.

1674754162.0,Leaked Video Chats With Inmate BF Caused Vet. Florida Teacher To Resign,"A veteran teacher, Donna Barber was so embarrassed she decided to resign swiftly. She was employed at the Franklin County School District for 30 years and was near retirement. 

Everything in her life was going well— she had a boyfriend who she communicated with very often. Donna Barber’s boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, was an inmate at the local prison. 

Donna Barber and her boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, would often video chat. By the way——-their video chats were steamy. On some occasions, Donna Barber would remove her clothes and participate in explicit conversations while on the job.

Once again, Donna Barber worked in a school with children. I’m not quite sure about the specific age or grade level. However, the inappropriate acts and verbal exchange in the workplace is off limits especially a school setting. 

Since, Lawrence Ray was an inmate he was breaking the rules, too. There’s strict rules that he disobeyed during their frequent calls.

Also, Donna Barber’s actions weren’t criminal as mentioned by the local state attorney. But….. the Franklin County School District began to investigate where her calls took place and the timing which were during school sessions.

According to the online records, Donna Barber was told that the school board would recommend termination. Since, her video chats were leaked to the public-she swiftly resigned. She nearly had a great retirement with pension and full benefits.

1674585850.0,Vent RE reference,"Just have to quickly vent that the first AP I emailed about writing me a reference turned me down. I was an ESL teacher at several inner city Title 1 schools for 3 years. I had to leave over a year ago when my parents were both facing life -threatening health problems, multiple heart attacks and Covid. (I had requested unpaid leave, 4 times, FMLA and board approved, but our system was so overwhelmed that nothing was ever processed, so eventually I had no choice but to resign.)

The nature of being a floater doing pull-out at multiple schools means no one is in a great position to write you a reference.

However, the AP in question was the most recent to observe me and gave me a satisfactory review.

I also spent many extra hours per day at the start of the pandemic helping her contact all families about devices and WiFi hotspots and update complex excel charts for her supervisors and so on. Unpaid, of course, just an extra admin duty I agreed to help with.

I just can’t believe that after all the blood, sweat, and tears I put into that job, plus spending hundreds if not thousands of my own money in supplies, that she can’t cough up a generic reference!

I loved the kids, but I’m regretting ever going above and beyond at that job. It nearly destroyed my health. So glad to be free.., but I need references to get back into teaching, and it would be nice if my admin would step up just a bit!

Anyone else in this boat??

I’m an elementary ESL teacher (previously taught middle school English and French and Spanish).

I’m coming from Maryland where I’m fully certified.

I have 5 years of public school teaching experience (the most recent 3 years at a cluster of Title 1 schools from hell), 11 years of community college teaching experience, and 2 years of private school ESL teaching experience.

Can anyone tell me about the reality on the ground teaching high school ESL or English in or around LA? 

Good schools? 
Schools to avoid at all costs?
What teaching ESL is like at the high school level in LA?

The ARTC program feels like such a terrible and financial way of exploiting young teachers. I barely make 1,000 a paycheck. I've already had to borrow money from family, I've had to go to loan sharks, and get bank loans and it just never seems to stop. It's all so discouraging. Delaware in case anyone is wondering. I'm basically too broke to be a teacher. I've been seriously considering just managing a Walgreens or something. At least then, I won't feel like I'm being constantly forced to pay out ridiculous amounts of money. I still have no idea how I'm going to come up with 7,000 dollars to keep my job where I get cussed out by highschoolers..... I also did not qualify for reimbursement because I accepted a position as a long term sub. Silly me, I thought I was doing them a favor, they told me I no longer qualified for reimbursement because I wasn't a real teacher at the time. I have my contract now and was re hired as a teacher but then was told that I missed the application window.    It's just all so frustrating. I love teaching.

1674102926.0,A student stole $40 from me 6 weeks ago. Shouldn’t the school reimburse me?,"It’s not even a question that he stole it. I had three twenties folded together in my pocket, and when I took my keys out, they dropped on the floor. As I was bending over to pick them up, the student I was talking to (14) bent over to pick them up first. I thought, “That’s awfully nice of him, picking up something for a man in his 50s!” But, no. He goes, “Finder’s keepers!” then walked out into the hall. 

I said, “Ha, ha. Very funny. Please give me back my money,” but he only handed me $20. I said, “What about the other $40?” He said there wasn’t any more, then turned around and put the $40 in his underwear. Because he had gone into the hall, we got very clear security footage of him doing that, so the dean, my boss and I got his mom on speaker and we all pleaded with him to hand it over. He refused. After about 10 minutes, I went back to class because I had work to do. As I was leaving, my boss said, “Sorry that happened to you.”

They suspended him for the remaining two hours of the day, but he refused to leave, meaning he got to spend the day in the building without going to class, which is what he does all the time, anyway. So, essentially he faced no consequence. During that time, he admitted to the dean that he stole it but couldn’t give it back because he “lost” it.

At his re-entry meeting, we again tried and failed to get my money back. He says his mom told him she would have done the same thing which I totally believe because I never even got an apology from her, much less the money her kid stole. The dean has been advocating for me to get reimbursed but gotten nowhere. I also asked the principal and didn’t even get a response. 

So, I put in my two weeks. I don’t have another job lined up and probably won’t go back into education, but fuck that. Seventeen years experience as a special ed teacher, an MA, and certifications in ELA and Social Studies / History, but they’re willing to throw that away for $40. I guess a job requirement for teaching now is a willingness to be robbed? I also just can’t teach this child any more because every time he wants something from me, all I can think is, “Oh, you want a pencil? Use the $40 you stole from me to buy a whole box.”",TeacherReality
1674060069.0,Teacher shortages prompt Bridgeport to consider moving students from Wilbur Cross to Thomas Hooker,"Cross needs 5 teachers, including a K Sped teacher and Resource Room, and the parents are livid. The school is currently using online learning (games) to keep the students occupied. Unfortunately, the district doesn't provide Sped teachers access to their online curriculum, and tell them to 'develop their own'. They also ignore IEP's and refuse to provide paras, which when they exist are paid $25,000. 

This, of course would be possible if $ was spent on lots of Teacherpayteacher worksheets, or if the teachers were professors at top schools with lots of money and help from interns. When I tweeted to the superintendent that he should rethink this issue, I was blocked from his official account.

1673817358.0,feeling horribly guilty for leaving my current school for another one,"I'm currently working for an alternative high school for at risk students. I want to leave because of ridiculous expectations from the corporates and the lack of community/spirit (I like most of my colleagues, but they are definitely not my friends and some colleagues really do make my days difficult). I am underpaid for my qualifications, our health plan is a patchwork of ridiculous plans that no doctor ever understands so I spend ALL of my lunch breaks on the phone with various providers to try to get simple doctor's visits covered. I have no retirement plan and I just arrived to the US with no saving and no plan for retirement. I keep getting undermined by corporates, colleagues can't put on their left sock on without me despite their seniority in the school (I've only been with them for a year and a half), more and more busy work with no real goal or growth out of them. Because of low enrollment I am incredibly bored. We also only have winter break, no fall or spring break. They often give holidays to the kids but make us come to school all day to ""plan"". No team building, we don't even have a break room, just. Meeting room with no window that happens to have a fridge and microwave. I spend my lunch breaks in my car!

So I have so many reasons to leave. But I feel so guilty, and I'll miss my students so much, because I do really love my students, they are the best part of the job. I feel guilty I am leaving a school that currently can't function without me. But at the same time I'm going to a school that needs me even more!

The new school has teachers my own age, happy students, spirit and community. It has a retirement plan and a real health insurance to offer as well as gas stipends, and more pay. AND I'll be able to put my daughter in pre-k there which will save me at least 10k!!!!! My days will be shorter. At the moment I only get 20min a day with my daughter, in the new school I would get an entire afternoon with her nearly everyday. And I can tutor for $25/h whenever I want which is really nice and I would still be home earlier than I am now.

So many reasons to be happy, and leave my current school behind. But the amount of backlash I am about the receive when I announce my departure, I'm also not giving notice as I am in an at will state and the school will withhold my last paycheck according to my contract (f them I'm not going to work for free!) so I will literally be gone overnight. And the disappointment of my students who are fragile teenagers who look up to me and who I absolutely adore... Urgh

In my decade of education I have had students who have experienced essentially every type of trauma you can imagine. 1 of my elementary students was murdered by his mother’s boyfriend. A 9 year old committed suicide. And another drowned in his bathtub after being drugged by his mother and then left unattended. 

I was hospitalized twice for injuries inflicted on me by students. I was told by my principal that getting a concussion from being head butted by a student was a REASONABLE EXPECTATION of my job. 

I had a complete mental breakdown a few months ago. I went through a severe bout with anxiety and depression and had to choose between my well-being or this job.

And here’s the kicker- I gave this job everything I had until I completely fell apart. When I had to resign because my physical and mental health were at serious risk, my principal didn’t even bother to respond to my resignation and just sent out an email to the staff about the logistics of covering my caseload. We are all completely indispensable. 

I honestly can’t believe I got out. A huge weight has been lifted, and this is the happiest I’ve been in years. I’m back to being myself. I’m back to being fun and happy.

1673367862.0,How to maintain order in my classroom when there's no support from admin?,"I'll be honest, guys.  I'm trying to leave this profession as quickly as possible.  I'm miserable.  My (middle) school is in complete disarray after a series of scandals, firings, quittings, and restructuring.  I won't get into it all here, but the result is that we're overcrowded, understaffed, dealing with an inexperienced new admin staff who create insane policies, and pure chaos from the students: daily fights, drugs, sex acts, etc. In the meantime, until I can make the switch, I'm just trying to survive.

The two biggest problems are lack of motivation/work completion and behaviors.  The first problem can be traced to a lot of things like COVID and lower standards, but perhaps the greatest cause is our school-wide policy of having to accept late work with no penalty until the end of the quarter.  I just had a student, who for the past quarter has screwed around and turned in nothing, email me a list of 10 assignments she completed, which I am forced to accept, and her grade went from a D- to a B+.  This leads to my nearly 200 students all being able to treat the entire school day as free time, then put in maybe 4 hours of effort at the end of the quarter and pass.

The second problem is bolstered by the first as well as other factors, but the result is that our admin is so overwhelmed dealing with high profile incidents, that absolutely nothing happens when a student has a minor infraction.  Dress code, talking over the teacher, food, cell phones, and games in class.  I could spend my entire day writing referrals (we don't have the authority as teachers to administer any other consequence such as a detention), but most of these referrals are ignored by admin or result in a quick 2-minute office lecture and then back to class.  Those who return to class stride in triumphantly and are admired by their peers.  Students show each other their behavior logs as a badge of honor.

What I'm left with is 6 periods a day, each over 30 students, who ignore everything I say, talk non-stop, get up and move around the room at will, sitting wherever they want, texting, throwing things, hitting each other, screaming, and me, trying hard to pretend that anyone is listening to me talk about metamorphic rocks.  Verbal warnings do nothing. Yelling does nothing. Writing kids up only encourages them.  When a parent finally concerns themselves with a student's grade, I get an email from said student listing all the assignments I should have forgotten about month's ago that I now have to spend time searching for online and grade.

What can I do to weather this storm until I can get out?  Is there any hope of having an effective seating chart and keeping kids in their assigned seats? Once again, I've spent hours upon hours writing behavior logs and referrals and speaking to admin about the problems with no success.  What can I do on my own, when there are no policies in place to support me, so that I don't feel like a prison guard who's just trying keep students' hands off each other and maintain my sanity.

Our sessions are 3 hours long, and I do “potty time” during centers, which is about halfway through our session. 

I asked this student if he needed to use the bathroom, and he said, “no.” Okay. 

30 minutes later, we do our second circle. He was dry at this time. 
Second circle is 20 minutes long, and parents pick up at the end. 

His mom was 10 minutes late. A few minutes later, she violently knocks on my door. When I opened it, she yelled at me because he was “soaking wet.” I told he that he was dry when circle started, and she asked how long ago that was (at this time, 30 minutes). 

Then she yelled that if it ever happens again, he won’t be coming back, and stomped away. 

I went back in and noticed a wet spot on the circle carpet. 

He will now be in my “you have no choice by to try” category, but DAMN!",TeacherReality

This is my first official teaching gig, I had previous experiences but I was never the teacher in charge. My issue is the kids seem uninterested in the material and they don’t even know the basics of English. I’m supposed to be teaching them conversational english, but they barely know how to say their name and their age in English. I try to make it as entertaining and appealing to them as possible and they just don’t care. Aside we have great chemistry and they love me as their teacher, but when is time to learn, they don’t bother. I’ve tried implementing, technology, Kahoot, games, dynamics discussions and still nothing.What can I do to stop this? I’m having a serious case of Imposter syndrome. Is it because I’m young and unexperienced? maybe thats why they don’t really want to study and learn with me? Any tips on how to teach a new language to teenagers with nearly no knowledge of it and no interest in learning it?",TeacherReality

Over the the last two years 16 people have either quit or transferred. Her and I got into a disagreement a few weeks ago due to the way she spoke to me in front of some kids and since then she has not liked me. Anyway, I was hired to be an EA in a resource room, due to the obvious nature of the job, before and during my interview (and several times after) I disclosed how I do not feel comfortable working with children who have some form of autistic spectrum disorder, of course it has nothing to do with a prejudice of any kind, just knowing myself I do not work well with individuals such as that. I was told it wouldn’t be a problem and my place in the resource room would center around some of the kids who struggle behaviorally. Well there is a child with autism who is on the case load and he requires an aid with him, the aid he originally had continuously called off and administration would have me to be his one-on-one aid. I reminded them of my disclosure but helped anyway because I am a team player. Two weeks ago they fired his aid and I agreed to help until the board could approve a new hire to take over. Last week they told the intervention specialist they were changing the way her room was ran, hiring a new EA to help her and changed my schedule to be his full time aid without talking to me at all. I know as an EA they can move me around however, I disclosed several times, to several different people my feelings on working with that particular population and now I am essentially being forced and I don’t know what to do.",TeacherReality

1665787291.0,"Haverhill and Malden, Massachusetts Education Associations vote to strike","The members of both the Haverhill Education Association and the Malden Education Association today overwhelmingly approved strikes to begin Monday if their respective contracts are not settled over the weekend.

Educators will be holding rallies on Saturday, first at 1 p.m. at Haverhill City Hall and then at 4 p.m. at Malden City Hall.

The HEA and MEA released the following joint statement:

“It is no coincidence that the educators in both Haverhill and Malden took votes today to authorize strikes if their respective contracts are not settled before Monday. Several unions representing thousands of educators in communities north of Boston meet regularly to discuss our working conditions, which are our students’ learning conditions. The educators in Haverhill and Malden have been working without contracts. The respective unions have made numerous proposals to address staffing shortages, racial and social justice, safety in schools, adequate time for educators to prepare and collaborate, and wages that have been chronically suppressed. The school committees in both communities are showing no interest in addressing needs we see as critical to our students’ success.

“We are saying enough is enough. Our students deserve better, our communities deserve better, and we deserve better.

“We acknowledge the disruption our strikes can cause. But we can no longer in good conscience see our students receive less than they deserve and for educators to be continually disrespected as professionals. We are ready to bargain any time to settle these contracts. Our respective school committees have the power and authority to avert these actions.”",TeacherReality
1665643908.0,Needing some advice and a rant,"Hi guys. Discovering this subreddit has been therapeutic.

I’m a first year ECT and 5 weeks in I already feel like I’m sinking. The school I’m at has a very intensive marking policy. All books marked and an assessment competed, marked and feedback given every three weeks (so twice a half term). Ive got 10 class groups so you can do the maths here…I’ve been staying up until 11 o clock two or three weeknights every week trying to get through it and I’m already not staying ahead. I got quite sick last week, and although the change of weather of course played a part I also think it was spurred on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. 

Yesterday I got pulled in by a member of SLT as a complaint that I hadn’t marked one of my student’s books. I had already marked that class’s books but the student but have been absent when I took them up. Half way through the conversation I felt like I couldn’t even hear what they were saying to me and I had a really strong urge to just leave the building.

I feel like I’ve already checked out mentally and I don’t want to stay in this job. I know it’s really bad to leave a teaching position mid year, but I truly think I could see myself having a breakdown if I stay.

If I left, I was thinking I could do supply work until my lease is up on my apartment. Or even just find work in a cafe.

1665355055.0,"Going on my second year, and I’m feeling overwhelmed to the breaking point.","Hello all,

This is going to be my second year of teaching, and I just don’t know how to handle all of what is being piled onto my plate. I know this is what I signed up for, but I’m starting to feel depressed and hopeless. I’m not looking for any advice, I just want to let out what I’ve been holding in for some time.

For a little background, I started off teaching at am elementary school near the city, and I ended up having to quit mid-year right before Christmas break because I couldn’t handle teaching at that particular school anymore. I loved my kids, but I had two that needed a lot of extra supports due to special needs and behaviors that I couldn’t provide, and neither had a para to help them while I taught. I ended up getting assaulted by one of my more challenging students, and my cries for help fell on deaf ears, so I left. It was so bad there that I ended up being on a heart monitor because I was so stressed.

I’m at a better school now, but because I left halfway through, I’m behind on mandatory LETRS training, and I feel like the pressure keeps building every single day. Every week something new is piled onto our plates and no one asks “What can we do to help you?” Or asks what they can take away from us. I spend my one hour of planning during the day grading and talking to parents and lesson planning, but more often than not I’ll have to stop because we have ten other different self-directed PDs to complete by a certain deadline. Not to mention we have an entirely new curriculum, are fumbling through it at best, and are of course dealing with behaviors that have only worsened since the pandemic. I know this is common, but I feel so burnt out and alone. I try my best to create boundaries so that I don’t work at home or on weekends, but that means I’ll be at the school until five or six. 

I just feel like breaking down and crying. I feel like I can’t even give my loved ones any attention because of my job. My boyfriend lives in another state and we are both so tired we hardly have but one call a week, I haven’t seen any of my friends in months, and my cat that I’ve had for 14 years has cancer and is dying and I feel like I don’t even have the time or energy to sit with my sadness about that. I also have lost all ability to organize and be productive. My memory gets worse and worse each day and I feel like an idiot when I forget due dates and deadlines. I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD but it is taking forever to find a doctor who will actually get me the help I need, and I feel desperate.

My plate is broken. It can’t hold anything. I want nothing more than to just teach and love my kids, but inside I feel like the whole world is caving in on me. I’m trying my best every day, but sometimes my best is just getting out of bed every morning.",TeacherReality

1664899844.0,I thought I had a great job at a great school until..,"So, I posted this as a comment to somebody’s post about admin treating them poorly but I’ve wanted to make it into a post as I’m still having trouble making sense of what happened. 

I am an educator who’s been in the field for over ten years. I’m currently getting my MA in Early Childhood Education, as this is what I teach in. I’ve been teaching preschool for the past five years and have been working at one school in particular. Last year, my supervisor left and I was asked to step up in her place. I had no prior training or experience running a preschool but I worked tirelessly with my admin day in and day out to create curriculum, build a community, maintain safety in the classrooms, and make sure the kids were well taken care of. I had built great relationships with families over the years and taught their children as well as the siblings. I was teaching a preschool 3s class and I even had a parent call to make sure I would be teaching it the following school year (this year). Since that was my class, I told her yes and she gladly told other parents who then enrolled their kids to stay in the program and continue in my class. 

During the school year I had a lot of problems with staff because most of the teachers I worked with were not teachers but more so looking for part time gigs. I heard a lot of, “well I don’t get paid enough for this shit” or “this is toddler school so it means nothing.” I also had issues with asking them to sanitize during a freakin pandemic. You would have thought I was the supervisor from hell if you asked them but I was the first director of that school that never made teachers feel guilty for calling out and told them they needed to put themselves first. I treated them like humans. I worked very closely with a teacher who was my assistant one year and then became my second in command once I stepped up. We had a great relationship until we learned she had been lying about being in grad school. Not only was this against the law, and her contract, but management didn’t want to get rid of her mid year in fear of the parents reactions.  As the months went on the lies piled up. From little white lies about prepping materials to lying about things such as being pregnant and getting surgery. I felt she was a liability but nobody took me seriously.

After such a trying and mentally exhausting year, I decided to take the summer off and return in the fall. I work at a private school so summers were not paid but you could work at the camp there. Anyways, as I was preparing to go back to the classroom, it was decided that somebody who was more qualified to be director would take over my responsibilities, and being in grad school at the time, I was ok with this. My management told me I should be focusing on grad school, which they were paying for and said I needed my masters in order to grow there. 

Fast forward to the end of summer, I tell them I got approved for student teaching and would be out of the classroom one day a week in a school my grad school placed me in. It was not up to me and I couldn’t do it at my work site. 
Once that was said, they told me I “wouldn’t be happy returning” and that they needed someone full time in the classroom even though it would only be for one semester AND they would have the staff to cover the one three hour shift a week when I wasn’t there. I figured out that once they realized they could use my salary to hire more shitty teachers as bodies, they decided they didn’t need me anymore. I rarely pat myself on the back but I did everything for them and I was honestly a model teacher. Even when parents called them angrily after hearing I wasn’t returning, they still didn’t seem to budge. 

All I wanted was to continue teaching the 3s class and as an even bigger slap in the face, they ended up giving my class to the teacher that had been lying to everyone all year. 

Basically, I’m writing this because I’ve been losing sleep over it and I’m so angry at them for kicking me to the curb. I did EVERYTHING for them. I kept a school open during Covid. I wrote their entire curriculum. I stayed up late at night with my Cricut machine making stickers and prepping activities for my kids on the regular. I built incredible relationships with families, but, I guess it wasn’t good enough? I’m still in grad school but now I’m second guessing everything. Do I even want to do this anymore? Am I a good enough teacher? I still feel so broken about it and it’s been a month now. 

Truly, I’d love to enter the field of education policy one day so I can work for the true MVPs, the mother fucking teachers. We deserve more than management could ever understand and it’s just..

So. 
Damn. 
Frustrating. 

Maybe I just needed to vent but honestly, any advice is helpful.

Imagine if you were able to choose educators the way that you choose who cleans your child's teeth, or serves as your nurse in a hospital.

Teachers had to come to school masked while students roamed freely maskless. Our COVID sick days were reduced to 5 per year. I took medical leave for 2 weeks and ended up losing over half my monthly paycheck because the rate to pay subs is higher than my daily rate.  Had a high school kid threaten to shoot up the school during my class. Kid is returned to my class weeks later. I had no explanation of what happened during that time. Same year had a 4 hour bomb threat lockdown where students were peeing in buckets and other containers bc we couldn’t go in the hall. Thanks to tik tok, Kids were vandalizing bathrooms so most bathrooms were locked up, causing students to need to miss class for 15 min just to find the nearest bathroom. Also thanks to tik tok, it was a trend to sexually assault your teacher by smacking them on the butt. A parent wanted to interview me for what I was teaching for the ENTIRE YEAR and I was required to attend that interview. We were asked to do janitorial duties because janitors were asked to work holidays for $11/hour and so they all quit. I teach ceramics and the room lacked safe ventilation. I didn’t have my own classroom, or an office for planning and it’s kind of necessary when your an art teacher to prep materials in the room you teach in. I have a masters with 8 years of certification and was being paid less than 55k per year in one of the most expensive cities in the USA. With health insurance and everything else deducted, I was barely taking home 3500 per month. What makes this worse is that teachers are bound to an annual contract that only benefits school districts (did you know they can just move you to another school at will if they choose? Or make you teach at two schools in one day so you have to travel for lunch?) They try to make it seem like breaking a contract will ruin your career and teachers do buy into this myth.  I left teaching that year to work remote in tech in an entry level job and already get paid more after 4 months of being here.

He’s at a loss for what could be next.  He has a bachelors degree in psychology, has coursework in ASL interpreting but didn’t complete the program and doesn’t want to be an interpreter, and is one of the kindest most caring individuals out there.

Update: I resigned today with someone from HR (principal was gone early today). I just got an email that I need to ""report to work and speak with the principal before any decision is made"" as if I'm not an adult and me saying I resign isn't final.

Another update: I forgot to mention one of the reasons I  want to leave is that the principal has three pending lawsuits for sexual assault. My father is an attorney and checked/accessed some of the sealed files when I first said I was working there. I was TERRIFIED because I was already seeing red flags. School threatened my license and my dad wrote a letter stating that as a young woman I was frightened and under emotional distress when I learned about the lawsuits.

Dont get me wrong, i love my kids and i dont feel anxious when im in front of the classroom teaching idk why. When i get home from work, i rest for abit and then do more work to prepare for work the next day. I hate this about the job, its like endless work. Maybe if i stick to teaching at the same school it will get better?

I also feel like im teaching kids to constantly conform to rules and not question them (how to sit or speak or behave or dress or write). Its like teaching a bunch of unique individuals to act or think the same way. Idk if im overthinking this, i jst feel like im shaping these kids to be part of the machine. The kids who question the system or the rules are considered “naughty” or “disrepsectful” and must be punished. If they dont write their essay in the structure that was taught, they wont do well. I feel like there are many bright kids that just give up bcos their way of thinking doesnt fit what’s considered good by the curriculum.

I was at school today unpacking and setting up my classroom because tomorrow we have two two hour meetings back to back.

I am currently looking for other jobs but so far I haven’t gotten anything. I live in the middle of nowhere so local employment is Walmart, the hospital, and the school.

I was let go that same year because I “wasn’t doing enough” according to admin. I was upset at their reasoning but felt relief as I didn’t love teaching anyway.

I decided to take the following year off of teaching and started to look for other jobs. I have a very specialist degree and two very specialist credentials. From September to May of last year I applied to hundreds of jobs for onboarding or HR and never even got an interview. I was an emotional wreck at this point and gave in and applied to one of the better private schools for the subject I teach. 

I got the offer and accepted it. I was so excited to be done job searching. As the start of the school year has gotten closer I’m DREADING the start of the school year. I hate teaching, I’m good at it and students like me but I absolutely hate it. On top of that the school pays so little I’ll be going negative about $1,000 a month.

Principal concluded that the lounge is a ‘toxic environment’ (because we vent and discuss admin’s managerial shortcomings as well as the school problems that come as a result) so he got rid of it, saying we can share one with the school on one of the upper floors (we’re in a basement and a small school that gets bullied by the others, so we feel shy about intruding on another school.) He didn’t make his reasoning public, but I overheard him tell a custodian, “they sit in there and talk shit, they can go talk shit upstairs, I don’t have time for that.” 
Talking shit being, ‘they promised we’d have computers for students in September, it’s now March and we still don’t have anything,’ and ‘Principal cornered and verbally abused me today, here is how to protect yourself.’ We know our admin work hard and do what they can with what we have, but that doesn’t make our school not a shit-show.

**On May 24, 19 students and two teachers were shot and killed at** [**Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas**](https://time.com/6181501/texas-school-shooting-victims-uvalde/)**—the   deadliest mass shooting in our state’s history. I remember staring at   my phone as the gut-wrenching headlines rolled in: fourth-grader** [**Miah Cerrillo**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/08/uvalde-congress-students-testify-gun-violence/) **had covered herself in her classmate’s blood to trick the shooter into thinking that she was already dead; teacher** [**Arnuflo Reyes**](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/us/uvalde-school-teacher-arnulfo-reyes-interview/index.html)**, who was shot in the arm and lung, lost 11 students in his class; and the body of 10-year-old** [**Maite Yuleana Rodriguez**](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/07/1103577387/matthew-mcconaughey-green-converse-shoes-sneakers-uvalde-maite-rodriguez) **was  so disfigured from the bullets that she could only be identified by   her lime-green Converse with a heart drawn on the right toe.  On the  news, the pictures of** [**grieving families**](https://time.com/6181718/uvalde-shooting-grieving-community/) **clinging  to one another, and of children climbing from windows and  sprinting  away from the school-turned-war zone with faces twisted in  shock and  confusion, were haunting. That same night, my friends and I  stayed up  late sharing articles and TikTok updates with the same  heaviness that  we’d felt after** [**Parkland**](https://time.com/6198426/parkland-shooting-sentencing-trial-day-one-recap/)**,** [**Santa Fe**](https://time.com/5282212/santa-fe-high-school-texas-school-shooting/)**, and** [**Oxford High**](https://time.com/6125256/michigan-school-shooting-covid/)**—now,   with the choking pain of another tragedy added to the list. It was the   dystopian familiarity of coming of age in the gun era.**

**When  I arrived at my Texas high school the next day, an administrator  was  standing at the door with a cart full of confiscated items. Of  course,  there were backpacks, which were never allowed during finals  week, but I  was surprised to see smaller bags, too—brown paper lunches,   end-of-the-year gifts for teachers—that my school had never taken up   before. Right before I could enter the building, the administrator   pointed at my laptop bag. “With what happened yesterday,” she explained   in an apologetic whisper, “we’re just on edge.”**

**I  handed over my bag without a second thought because I knew exactly how   my administrator was feeling. Like most American schools, we stop   breathing over Snapchat threats and warning messages posted to   Instagram. It’s only when the kid is caught with a gun in their pants   that we can breathe easy again, our grim relief that no one was hurt   outweighing the terror of what might have been. Because they could’ve   pulled the trigger, we face active-shooter drills that eat up entire   class periods and get trained to leave the door locked at all times, no   matter who’s begging to be let in—a peer, a principal, a best friend.   Sometimes, we even analyze hiding spots or plan for what to do if we’re   in the hallways, bathrooms, staircases, or cafeteria when the gunfire   starts, despite knowing, deep down, that nothing can really prepare us   for a moment like staring down the barrel of an assault rifle.**

**And with every school shooting—**[**27 so far, in 2022 alone**](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01)**—our fears gain legitimacy. It’s why lawmakers** [**are rallying around more armed on-campus officers**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/24/texas-republicans-uvalde-gun-control/) **and extra security checkpoints, and why Texas Republican** [**Senator Ted Cruz** ](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/sen-ted-cruz-proposes-one-door-entry-at-tx-schools-safety-experts-say-its-not-feasible)**pitched the idea of “having one door that goes in and out of the school.” Other prominent figures like** [**former President Donald Trump**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/27/donald-trump-nra-houston/) **and** [**National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre**](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/nra-wayne-lapierre-cpac-gun-rights-school-safety/2016151/) **seem to be reading from the same teleprompter flashing the same incessant buzzword: just** [**“harden” the schools**](https://time.com/6187656/school-safety-mass-shootings/)**.**

**But   while I understand that the knee-jerk reaction to violence is a push   for stronger security, I can’t help but ask questions. Why did I have to   give up my laptop bag? Why was my administrator screening for threats   like she was a TSA officer or a prison warden instead of a school   staffer? And why was my school—an educational institution—shouldering   the responsibility of checking for weapons to keep students and staff   from being gunned down?**

**Most  of all, I’m stunned that the concept of hardening schools is even a   casual talking point. To me, it feels like an admission—that gun   violence is the new normal, that school shootings will inevitably happen   again, and that there’s nothing we can do but to brace ourselves for   the next bang.**

**If  lawmakers don’t pass critical, common-sense gun laws like universal   background checks and 30-day waiting periods for gun sales that** [**are supported by the majority of Americans**](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx)**,   will students, already sandwiched between the social pressures of   fitting in and the pressure-cooker environment of academics, be forced   to brave even more active-shooter drills? Forced to resign ourselves to   the constant fear that our hallways might one day turn into a shooting   range? And on top of creating lesson plans and grading assignments,  will  teachers be expected to fend off an armed gunman,** [**a feat that even trained law enforcement officers couldn’t manage in Uvalde**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/20/uvalde-police-shooting-response-records/)**?**

**I don’t want to go through metal detectors and get my** [**clear backpack**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna862176) **searched  before taking a history test surrounded by steel doors and  bulletproof  windows. I don’t want my teachers, who are already  overworked and  underpaid, to lecture with a marker in one hand and a gun  in the other.  And I don’t want my school to be an impenetrable fortress  where I  learn how to instinctively run to the nearest exit instead of  how to  solve a math problem. It shouldn’t have to be that way for  students to  be safe at school.**

# Staffing shortage leads to involuntary teacher transfers at Montgomery County schools

 

**by John Gonzalez**

**Thursday, July 21st 2022** 

&#x200B;

 **MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. (7News) — Several public school teachers in Montgomery County say their summer break is coming to an abrupt end.** 

**Officials  with Montgomery County Public Schools have sent out a long list of  involuntary teacher transfers -- Some teachers received calls from  principals while on vacation. The union says the school system has  violated its contract.**

 **At Sherwood High School, close to two dozen staff members have been  relocated to other schools or told they will move into other positions,  with very little notice. Teachers report back to schools in about a  month.**

**7News  obtained a copy of the MCPS teacher contract, and it clearly states,  that principals will notify employees who have been involuntarily  transferred no later than Monday, February 28, 2022, and will provide  the (MCEA) education association a list of unit members identified for  involuntary transfer by the third Friday in March.**

**Also in the  contract it says, every effort will be made to notify the unit member of  the need for an involuntary transfer prior to the job fairs.**

 **In order to fill major staff shortages in other schools and cover  budget downfalls, some school electives and courses such as ESOL,  Women’s Studies and Business classes have been drastically reduced or  dropped.**

**Some 9th and 10th-grade classrooms already have 33 to 35 kids, more students than most classrooms have desks.**

**The  most recent school year ended with 581 unfilled positions countywide.  Meanwhile, 973 teachers have indicated they will be resigning or  retiring -- Which means class sizes are bound to increase.**

 **The teacher’s union says this situation violates the teacher contract --  several employees are being involuntarily transferred, receiving  surprise emails this week while on summer break. The union says they  should have been notified at least five months ago.** 

 **MCPS teacher resignations and retirements are up 38% in the past school year.**

**There are currently about 400 open teaching positions.**

**7News reached out to the school district and they sent us the following statement:**

***“School  systems across the country and throughout the region are faced with  challenges concerning open positions. One way to ensure that schools  have the employees needed is to transfer from a school with a surplus to  a school with a deficit, doing so ensures that students have the  teachers, administrators and support professionals needed. We are  working vigorously to recruit for all of our open positions, we do this  throughout the school year and are doing so now so that we begin school  fully staffed.”***

1658544603.0,Former teacher says he earns higher pay as Walmart professional,"  

**By: Maia Belay,** [**Nexstar Media Wire**](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/?post_type=profile&p=7076) 

**Posted: Jul 21, 2022 / 10:37 AM CDT** 

**Updated: Jul 21, 2022 / 11:10 AM CDT** 

 

**CANTON, Ohio (**[**WJW**](https://fox8.com/news/former-teacher-says-he-earns-higher-pay-as-walmart-professional/)**) — A former teacher said he is making more money as a Walmart professional.**

**Seth Goshorn taught for nearly six years, including at an elementary  school in Canton, Ohio, before deciding to change careers. It’s a  decision he said that led to an increase in pay by about $20,000 after  factoring in bonuses.**

**Dressed in his new Walmart uniform, Goshorn recorded a TikTok  video acknowledging the dramatic pay gap. He said the video  unexpectedly went viral.**

**“I didn’t think it would be this good. I might get a couple hundred  likes, so just the fact that it blew up and I’ve only been on it for  like a year,” Goshorn said. “It was really cool to see just the power of  the internet.”**

**Goshorn, who has a degree in early childhood education, is now  working as a “Walmart coach” on the management track. More than one  month into his new job, he said the transition was smooth.**

 

**“Last year I made about $43K teaching, so not anything terrible, but it also still left a lot to be desired,” said Goshorn.**



**He said he loved his time as a teacher and made lifelong friendships  with families. However, he was searching for a job that would better fit  his financial needs while planning an upcoming wedding with his  fiancée.** 

**Goshorn said working at Walmart provides professional growth without requiring a second degree.** 

**“My degree doesn’t exactly translate but the skills that a lot of  teachers have and the leadership ability teachers have does correlate to  a lot of companies,” he said. “So, find a company that’s willing to  train you for a position that might pay better.”**

**Goshorn does not discourage anyone from becoming a teacher and said  educators need additional support through increased salaries.**

&#x200B;

 **“Even though they’re scheduled for 40 hours, they’re working a lot  more than that, whether it’s teaching, grading after school,” Goshorn  said. “I coached football and track so those were other things on the  weekends. I did summer school. We don’t have all the time off that they  think.”**

**According to data referred to by the Ohio Department of Education,  the median teacher assignment salary statewide is $64,427. Salaries can  vary widely depending on which county and what school district a teacher  works in.** 

**Goshorn said he hopes his story serves as a teaching moment about the  power of the career pivot and the importance of supporting teachers.** 

**“I’m going to be a lifelong teacher,” he said. “That will always be a  part of my life, whether it’s at Walmart or on social media.”**

I taught for three years before becoming a full time technologist, and I'd heard some pretty wild stories back then. This app was inspired by one story in particular, where a female teacher friend of mine had to try to break up a fight during class between two male high school juniors. Not an ideal scenario. It would have been awesome to have a quick, discreet way to call for help.

In light of what happened in Uvalde and the lack of anybody doing anything about it, I'm releasing Little Red Button completely free and full featured (more features will be coming in the future). You can [download the iOS app here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/little-red-button/id1626397720) and you can [check out the website here](https://little-red-button.web.app/). A couple people have reached out about a more robust solution (eg for a special ed/SEAS school), so if that's something you're interested in, please reach out.

PS - Earlier this year I posted in a different sub about Little Red Button. At the time I was going to monetize it and it was going to be a Chrome extension. Neither of those are the case now.",TeacherReality

It's been said that one can find a lot of narcissism amongst higher academia, medicine, law and yes, school administration. All my admin had been good (mostly) until I was in my last job (which I quit).

 The principal was one of the those ""won't someone PLEASE think of the children!"" types who created a stifling, miserable environment by enacting draconian rules/guidelines that not only hurt staff but students too (e.g. requiring teachers to keep a violent child in their class and ""deal with it"" which not only was bad for the teacher, but created am unsafe space for the other kids). She also thought it was our responsibility to turn certain students who already hated school/teachers into school loving wonder kids. If we could not do that immediately, she'd torment us by questioning the ""culture"" of our classroom, w/o providing any examples or support/solutions. 
I'm not trying to rant here, but I'm crying as I write this, as I am still in heavy pain and am dealing with so much. Luckily, I found another job at a former school of mine. I still get to teach some, and I didn't have to take a big pay cut either. Thank you all so much

We went back and forth, but my SO is adamant that there are no jobs worth staying for and he's right. Even then, I kept insisting we find a way so I can stay and teach next year. I've only been at my current district one year, I have a teacher who is thrilled to coteach with me, I have kids excited to take my class. 

Then my SO said he honestly thinks I should quit for my mental health. My best friend agreed. Last semester caused my ED to relapse and I struggled with constant suicidal ideation.

I found this article problematic for a number of reasons.  The headline is misleading.  apparently Texas has been doing this for a long time.  no surprise here, I'm sure, but there are record numbers of teachers leaving their schools across the country.

We all know why.  It's different state to state. But it's really all the same.  In nc, gop legislator killed the teaching fellows program, a state program that covers higher education costs for people who teach.  They killed the pay increase for teachers when they get a masters.  And they adjusted the salary schedule to decrease pensions.  

Then nationally teachers are feeling the brunt of fairy tale propaganda around a ""liberal agenda"" and indictrination... district policies around covid they have no control of.  And then the difficulties in teaching during a pandemic when you're ""distance learning"" one week, face to face the next, and students and teachers both are in and out, quarantined for a week or two at a time.  

It's been rough.  

I have an msa.  Principals license in nc.  When I got the masters, I learned enough to know I'd never want the job of principal.  I just say that to vet my comment.

To be fired, teachers have to be given due process.  When they have tenure, they have a 4th(?) Amendment right to their job.  That's why it's hard to fire shitty teachers.  Side note: most important job of a principal is to make sure the adults in your school are good for kids.  Due process and documentation make it harder.  But that's the job.

I wonder if it could be argued that they have the same property right to their teaching license?  I know Texas legislators granted Texas state Ed dept authority to revoke licenses for leaving mid year.  But I sure as hell don't like that.  

The challenges teachers are facing right now are really hard.  But policies like this seem to place the blame of empty classrooms on teachers, penalizing them for giving up after having taken so much abuse that they just can't take it any more.

It's a job.  You can quit.  You shouldn't face prosecution for leaving a job.  Can you think of any other job where that hapens?

 Contract abandonment is a spin term.  Beginning teachers can be fired without due process when the district simply doesn't renew the contract.  So they get you coming and going.  

Sorry this is so long.  I'm sure nobody made it this far.  But wasn't it Arizona that brought in the national guard as warm bodies in classrooms? Texas is trying to stem the flow by MAKING them stay... at least til the end of the school year.  There is an exodus happening.  And I'm afraid that the  budgetary needs across the nation to fix the problems will be prohibitive.

2. This country values $$ over education & thus using education as a vehicle to collect money from others is a primary goal (High cost of education) 
3. A growing trend nationwide is to get rid of the educational system in the U.S. & do homeschooling or private schools exclusively. This is driven by BOTH sides of the ideology spectrum. In fact more Democrats have kids in private school than Republicans.

1647692205.0,My contract wasn't renewed and I'm so devastated,"This happened on Wednesday and I am taking it so hard. I have worked at this school in 7th grade for 6 years now, 3 1/2 as a para and 2 1/2 as a special education teacher. I got my certification while working. My job is insanely hard but I work really hard and I make great connections with my students. There was never any indication given to me that I wasn't doing a good job. I never had a review (until Tuesday, after they already knew that I was being fired), there was never a conversation, I was given no chances to improve. My coworkers all support me and think that I do a good job. I know I'm still green but I really felt like I was hitting my stride this year and starting to get the hang of it. I even sent an email to my boss saying that, though she already knew I was being let go. 

On Wednesday I was called into a room (with a union rep thankfully) and told that my contract is not being renewed for next year, but they would hire me back on as a para. This is insulting because it is about a 40% paycut, there's no way I can live on that. No reason is given, and since it's been less than 5 years, I don't think they have to give me one. 

I don't bring this up to garner sympathy, but it's important for context. I found out in December that my mom had terminal cancer and that she would be starting chemo. I am super close to my mom and she lives near me, this was absolutely devastating news. I shared this with my principal because I (naively) trusted her. She acted sympathetic at the time. I have major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. All of that was in check until my mom got sick, then I really fell off the deep end. 

At the encouragement of my principal and others (I do recognize that ultimately it was my decision) I took 3 weeks of FMLA so I could pull myself together. I saw a psychiatrist, changed my meds, started making lifestyle changes, and when I returned to work I legitimately felt so much better, and I really started feeling much better about my work. 

As I said, I am too trusting and my principal is privy to a lot of my mental health struggles but I won't get into all of that. It is important to note though, that she knows things about me that others don't which is why I think it was the impetus for my firing. I think they think I'm a wreck and not worth the hassle, and don't want to be around for the fallout when my mom passes. 

No one owes me any favors because my mom is sick, but it seems so heartless and cruel, and personal. I was never put on an improvement plan and never once told that I wasn't doing something right. My school is very supportive and I reach out for help when I need it and I am constantly eager for feedback on how to improve. I'm friends with everyone in the school, I'm friendly and well liked, and now I have to say goodbye to all these people I have worked with for 6 years. 

I also have to finish out the year, so I am reminded constantly of the pain and betrayal. I have to play it straight too because I can't get ""fired"" fired. I am hurting so bad, I feel like I'll always question other's kindness now, as I feel that is ultimately what cost me my job. Special ed is in high demand and I'm a HQT for middle school ELA, so I think I'll find a job, but it doesn't make this feel any better. Sorry this was so long, it weighs on my mind a lot. 

TL;DR I got fired from my teaching job with no explanation and no opportunity to improve, probably relating to my mental health issues. I am sad about it.",TeacherReality

Yesterday, I got a pretty terrific curriculum development offer. I wanted to share what worked for me, in case it’s helpful for any other soon-to-be-former teachers. 

-When it became clear that I needed to leave teaching, I started monitoring job boards for edtech and curriculum roles. 

-However, what I found more helpful was going to the individual websites for the different curriculum companies, professional development orgs etc that I’ve come to know over the years. I made a spreadsheet with the direct links to the relevant career page for each organization, so it would be easier to keep tabs on all of them quickly. 

-Here’s where luck somewhat took over. (I’m still trying to give myself credit. [ya know, imposter syndrome] but really, this was a lot of luck.)There was a posting for *three* openings in one of my specialty areas at a curriculum organization that I’ve know for years and have grown to deeply admire. 

-I applied, and then reached out to someone I sort of knew at the organization. This person was a lead curriculum designer for another content area, but I had a feeling he might be connected to this project too. I sent him an email saying basically, “You might remember me from xyz school, now I am very I interested in joining the abc team.” And he wrote back saying that he is actually the lead for the abc team had been pleased to see my application— score!

-From there, they had me do a take home assignment and a panel interview. And yesterday, they offered me the job!

-The downside is that it’s about a $10k paycut. I live in a very HCOL area, so my teacher salary was higher than average. However, the job is remote and the hours seem very reasonable. For me, the trade off is worth it.

This is my first and only school I’ve taught at for my entire career. We have a reputation for taking students who have been removed from other schools. I’ve had the INCREDIBLE opportunity to watch my kids grow and I’m excited to see who they will become.

However. 

It has now gotten to a point where there are so many escalations and disregulated students harming others (bullying, fighting, online harassment, and just straight up not letting anyone teach by yelling out and screaming at teachers) and I have no recourse aside from calling parents. Admin seem to be in survival mode and just want to keep people from physically hurting others until the end of the year. That’s it. I know they’re overwhelmed as well. But I’m tired of working three jobs and selling my plasma just to get by, only to be told by a ten year old that “I’m really starting to piss him off” just for having the audacity to ask him to stop talking during my class. Every day is constant arguing and struggle. I teach a specials class for gods sake (art, music, gym). We have fun! But the kids have been through so much in the past few years with quarantine and rough home lives; Everything has compounded and it just feels like the people above me have given up on them.

I thought I would share two things that have kept me from a complete and total breakdown. In all honesty, I hope that this information is not new to anyone and that everyone who needs it already has access to it! In the event that is not the case here are two resources that I hope can help some of you out there. 
Many schools and unions provide an EAP (Employee Assistance Program) as part of their benefits.  An EAP is to help provide resources for employees in a variety of areas. It can be used by everyone in your household. They provide references for mental health professionals in your area and depending on your program the EAP pays for several appointments. (The programs I have used paid for between 3 and 6 appointments.) They also provide referrals for child care, legal advice, financial advice, life coaching, etc. It is also completely confidential; they legally cannot inform your employer you have even contacted them. You can call them several times. For example, if you called about a conflict with an administrator, you can get your free sessions. You can call again about an issue with a parent and get another set of sessions. Had a fight with your husband? Call and get another set of sessions. I have not found a limit to this yet. Remember, anyone in your household can use it as well. If your spouse is struggling, they can get free sessions. If you have a child that is struggling, they can get free sessions. 
The other resource that I have found very helpful is NAMI, National Alliance on Mental Illness. I just started to be familiar with this organization. Their website has a lot of really good information. In some areas, they have support groups for people with mental illness and for their families. They have a help line 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) that is available M-F 10AM-10PM. What I found most helpful is their text line, my breakdowns tend to be in the evenings or Sundays.

1645491280.0,Do the poor working conditions filter for a personality type?,"First of all, let me first say what a relief it is to find this sub. The working conditions in teaching are NOT normal or acceptable, and it's nice to find others who can say it openly.

Second of all, I'm going to be very direct and frank in the commentary I want to make. I'm sorry if I word things awkwardly, and if there's a better way to express something, I'd appreciate some correction from others here.

Third of all, I want to speak from my own experience teaching in higher education. I have not been a k-12 teacher, though my wife is in a private school. I've been a university lecturer and college adjunct professor in a few different contexts. 

The working conditions in US higher ed are laughably bad. I used to see comically over-the-top labor abuses within the University of California, and someone described to me (accurately, I think) working as a college adjunct as being ""basically an uber driver."" I got frustrated after 3 years of the nonsense, and took an entry-level job at a luxury hotel doing manual labor. I actually made more money there even though it was a minimum wage job I could've gotten in high school, but I digress.

BY FAR the most frustrating aspect of teaching in higher education was **the other people I worked with**. I would see (again) COMICALLY over-the-top labor abuses and bureaucratic dysfunction in, for example, the University of California, but the other people in my same precarious position would bend over backwards into their own assholes to defend the schools and programs, at times as if they were defending their own families. I knew for a fact that these other lecturers had no financial incentive, had no promise of more stable working conditions, and could sometimes be under even worse conditions than I was. And yet, they pushed back against any and all criticisms of the schools/curriculum, even outside of the school in our personal lives. 

When I took entry-level jobs in the private sector, I would see similar abuses and mismanagement. The major difference was that *the other people I was working with* would openly articulate, talk about, and acknowledge that wrong things were going on. They normally would NOT bend over to defend inappropriate management, or the money guzzlers at the top. It is honestly a breath of fresh air to speak to others who can state plainly what is right in front of our faces. 

I have no sympathy for the people who are in those shitty working conditions at the universities I worked in. These were the same people who would fight tooth and nail to the death to convince me that the schools NEEDED to treat us like garbage, and that's the way it has always been, and I need to change my attitude. 

But...where in the world does this obsequies sycophancy come from? I have this working theory that I'm hoping others can help me with. 

One of the jobs that I took after getting fed up with higher ed was as an enumerator with the 2020 US Census. My gig with the census may have the biggest shitshow I have ever been a part of, and it was truly an appropriate crescendo for the Trump administration to purposefully make it into a shitshow, as the president's 1 term in office was coming to an end. 

However, the best part of the job BY FAR was going on the r/Census subreddit and shit-talking the whole thing with other like-minded people. Others had even worse experiences in the Census than I had had, with stories about inappropriate supervisors, dangerous situations that the bureau refused to rectify, and (to top it all off) the failure of the federal department to issue W-2 forms once the thing was all over. 

Somewhere along the line, towards the end of Census operations in October, something changed on the subreddit. MASSIVE amounts of people quit their census jobs, and I can only guess that not long after they quit, they stopped participating in the census subreddit. That meant that by the end of operations, rational people had already been long filtered out, and only the goobers were left. I remember that I posted a thread about a negative personal experience I had while out in the field, and I would receive replies along the lines of, ""Well, that sounds like a you problem!"", or ""You need to act more professional as a Census enumerator!"" My posts earlier into census operations WOULD NOT have gotten such responses. 

Given that I love teaching, I'm really good at it (I've gotten nothing but top evaluations in university/college settings), and I feel like I work well with middle-school aged students, I've thought about pursuing a position as a middle school teacher in a public school. Of course, here in California I would need to pay $15k for the credential that would allow me to even apply to jobs, I hesitated, but what really turns me off is the thought of the absolute wieners I may need to work with. When it comes to teachers, I've seen many things: people with personality disorders, hormonal imbalances, abusers, or mood disorders who take out their mental illness on powerless teenage students, tenured teachers who teach their class by simply having students stare at a wall for 2 hours (I've mostly seen this one in math classes for some reason), and of course the English Language Arts idealists who wish they were Robin Williams's character in *The Dead Poet Society*. The idealists concern me the most, as I see them as working with fewer professional boundaries. 

Shit conditions create a toxic workplace, in which talented and caring teachers are filtered out and only the losers are left. 

I want to leave, but then I think...my own kids are going to need to be taught in these failing systems someday. They will need to suck up to the abusive teachers with mood disorders or hormonal imbalances, and their future will depend upon their ability to get subjectively awarded letter grades from people who are lucky to have found a position paying them $40k per year. 

Am I on to something here? US schools seem to be a work environment that demands conformity to loser behaviors...right?",TeacherReality

1645133445.0,Question for Everyone (Especially Teachers) 🤔,"Hello Reddit world! This is my first ever post on any page of reddit, so I apologize in advance if I mess up the etiquette of posting, but please bear with me.

I have been worried lately about the troubling signs of the death of our public school system. Whether it's the conservative bills aimed at teachers curriculums, or the hateful rhetoric being thrown at teachers and their unions, I can't help but feel like America is on its way to privatizing the school system entirely, which terrifies me. I fear for the families that rely on public education for their children's schooling, and that would most likely be unable to afford a private education for their children. I'm also worried, that some of the loudest voices against teachers and public schools are also some of the people who would be impacted the most by the end of public schooling in America.

So, I wanted to ask the people and teachers here some questions. I will put them in a list below:
1.) Are you worried about the death of public schools in America?
2.) If public school ends, what do you think the new system will look like?
3.) Do you believe education will still be a requirement for families, one that is punishable by law if they choose not to have their children go to school/can't afford it?
4.) Do you believe education is a right? Or is it a privilege?
5.) How do you feel the end of public schools will affect the country (if it happens)?

Reddit admin has reinstated me as a moderator (I was the third moderator down before being removed by the previous top mod) as well as the other mods. Given the mess you see before you, you are probably wondering whether I am fit for this job (I know I am wondering the same thing). 

I want to assure you we are going to work to make this community better. We want a community that is inclusive of everyone who enters into it with good intentions. This was meant to be a sub that offered the public an understanding of the daily experience of teachers and guidance to teachers who, unfortunately, felt they could not continue in the profession. It was meant as a place to improve education, not disparage it or the professionals that put in the hard work every day to improve the lives of their students.

Teaching can be hard. I have been an educator for 16 years. I have attended my students' funerals. I have made the calls to CPS. I have been helpless to stop things I knew were wrong. That does not change my unwavering faith that the work we do is just and right. 

I want this work to be more sustainable. I'm tired of watching young teachers burn out. That is why we are here-- to offer care and support.

I have to finish my work day now (snow days aren't snow days anymore), but I hope you'll hang on as we restructure and bring this sub back to life. 

P.S. Mods should serve at the discretion of the community for benefit of the community. The hardest part of all of this for me was watching as someone who did not have the community's interest at heart acting like a petty tyrant. If you have concerns about the current moderation, please state them here. If it is necessary for me to step down, I will work to ensure first that competent, caring hands have control of moderation within the sub.",TeacherReality

If you are thinking of changing careers, but think you aren't qualified..... 

Teachers are belittled and taken advantage of to ensure we are kept in our place. We are constantly micromanaged so that we don’t think we are capable of other work or functioning and having success on our own in another workplace. This micromanagement/belittling is done to keep highly qualified teachers in the place where society needs us to be in order to take advantage of us. We are capable and qualified for many other things. Not to mention higher salaries. 

If you feel like you are unqualified for a job that you want, apply anyway. Most jobs in EdTech or tech startups are figuring it out as they go along. If you don’t understand the tech lingo, you are capable of adapting to the systems and the skills that you would need are learnable skills. 

Think of how much you had to learn on the job in a short amount of time in your first year of teaching. You are adaptable; sell that in your cover letter. You adapted to the pivot from in-person to online learning and you probably did it overnight; that makes you tech savvy. Be confident in yourself because you are worth more than you realize.

My class average is like a 33 and the only reason I let them slack off is because I cannot help that they were conditioned to not do any work, but the principal still expects that they pass for graduation rates to look good. 

So they will pass without deserving it.

Talk about sex, drugs, and drinking in front of me. Openly cuss with no regard to their environment.

I am shocked to say the least at what high school has become. I guess you really have to pick which hill you’ll die on but the standards have fallen so low for student conduct.

Those who evaluated me last year seemed very caring and like they were genuinely interested in making sure I improved. This year it’s much different, as a non-tenured teacher I feel my job is always at risk. I do not want to feel like this for another two year.

My lesson was not perfect but I felt that it was harsh given the sample size and context of the lesson. I feel that both observations I’ve had this year the take away is, “I would have done this, so that’s what you should have done.” I never want to lose my individuality as a teacher. 

It seems to add what they want in every single one of my lessons getting through the curriculum is out of reach and would take hours more planning. Some nights as is I plan and make materials till 10 or 11 pm. I don’t know how much more I can mentally give.

I stand up and I see him sitting there, his face all read as he's telling F that he's tired of his shit.  He keeps repeating, ""I'm tired of your shit!"" He slams his iPad down on the desk and stands up. The whole time I'm trying to get them to stop yelling at each other, but they have no interest in me in the slightest. F stands up as well, posturing to fight. They're at the verbal threats phase when I make it to the phone and dial for assistance. 

I'm still working hard to de-escalate the situation and try to keep these kids from killing each other but they're completely deaf to anything I have to say. Our psychologist (whose room is across from mine) comes over, and so does my neighbor teacher - she left her class because she heard the commotion.

The interventionist asked one of my co workers in PLC today where she was at on the unit and my co worker respectfully said she was not following the unit calendar but was still teaching the same material. The gifted teacher began to blow up at her and got angry that my co worker was not using this plan because it ""fit the prociency scale perfectly"". She continued to lay into her for no good reason and then thankfully, the bell rang. 

Fast forward to the afternoon PLC meeting. My other co workers brought up the incident so I said that I think what we were trying to convey this morning is that her and I are trying to meet the students where they are at skills wise. The gifted teacher then proceeded to lay into me and YELLED at me because ""there's no difference between any of the students on other teams"". Except that... I teach the ELL, intervention, and iep kids. She was so rude to me and then the advanced English teacher jumped in and literally said this comment to me ""that's what teaching is, we break things down so that the kids can understand it"". All I was trying to explain to them was that I had started the unit plan last week from day 1 and decided today that I was going to go back and re teach claim, evidence, and reasoning. It really was the most unprofesisonal thing I have experienced.

I found out from my co teacher that one of the 8th grade teachers leaves PLC in tears whenever the gifted teacher attends their meetings. This is not an isolated incident. 

I felt so undermined in that moment as a professional. I was shaking when I went to my meeting with my instructional coach because I was about to cry. I explained to my coach what happened and we sat down to go over the proficiency scale. She told me I was right on target and to focus on students building a strong argumentative paragraph instead of a five paragraph essay.

I started looking for jobs in October and it took me until January to find one.

This was a scary situation and I felt very alone. I would like to give some clarification of this incident as well as an update. Warning, it's still in progress but so far it hasn't been great. For context, I work with high schoolers in a rural town.

The situation was this: I was observing the lunchroom when he made a comment about someone's ass. I turned around and he said ""Why'd you turn around?"" In the moment I was very confused and it seemed like he had been speaking about me. As I stated, I informed my supervisor and principal. The next day the student found me while I was doing bus duty and he started yelling at me. When I informed the Principal, she later asked me if I would be willing to sit down and discuss it with him to ""take my power back"". We just had the meeting today...two weeks later.

The student alleged that they had been ""talking about their friend behind me"", and I just happened to turn around. I told him how bad it looked, and how he had no right talking to *anyone* that way. And that the reason why I had approached the principal about the situation was that if anyone looked at the incident from an outside perspective (adult and minor flirting), I could lose my job. I had to protect myself. I reiterated that his aggressive approach to me after the incident did not help his case either. He apologized for his behavior and for ""any unnecessary trauma he may have caused."" Whether he meant it or not is still up for debate...

I am currently in the process of trying to set up a meeting with HR to discuss how this was handled. How it felt like this was taken lightly, and not as serious as it could be. How I did not feel safe the, again, *two weeks* it took to set this meeting up. I asked for a male coworker to stand with me during bus duty just to feel slightly safer at my own job.

I also have informed my Union Rep, though technically I'm still in the process of having my application accepted. She is on my side and has been supporting me through all of this.

I'm sorry this isn't the big, badass update you all may have been wanting. But I'm still trying to find my footing in this. I promise I won't stop and let this slide.

What's stopping you from quitting and moving to something more valued by society?,"EDIT: After reading through these posts I think a common thread I'm seeing is that a lot of people just feel like it's their calling. I was talking to my wife about this exact topic last night and she said that a lot of teachers feel that way and that I wouldn't understand because I never have felt that way about a job and looking at these replies and thinking about it more I think she's right. 


I don't know if there's a way to word this without it coming off as maybe a little offensive but I am curious the thoughts of teachers on it.

I've been following the events of the last several years in regards to education. It seems like half the country just has a pretty anti-education stance at this point. They're banning books, parents are threatening teachers and administrators at board meetings, the kids seem to be out of control and not to give a shit largely... Cities don't properly fund schools so that teachers are expected to teach more and more kids each class to the point where it just seems impossible to do a good job. Schools are putting kids in debt for food... Also if you think of the salary that teachers get as a metric of how valued they are by society it's not good and honestly it's never been good. A huge and disproportionally powerful chunk of society just seems to be making it their personal mission to make the profession shittier.

My question is, why don't you just throw your hands up and go fuck it, fuck these kids and their stupid parents. The parents want to tell me how to teach, you teach your dumb kids then and they're going to grow up to be dumb fucks just like you, not my problem anymore. Do you feel trapped in the profession because it's what you went to school for? You're all smart people wouldn't a company want to hire you for something? Why not just quit and wash your hands of it all and just stop thinking about it. The country doesn't value education anymore and that seems to be getting worse so why not just give up on it?

I'm not a student or a parent and I never will be a parent so maybe that's why I have this attitude? I vote on increasing the budget and funding for schools whenever possible but I feel like people just don't value it, they don't want to pay for it. A lot of people say they support teachers but when it comes down to it I don't think they actually do, it's just lip service.",TeacherReality

I don't think many people will see this, but anybody who does... I appriciate you.

I have been looking at some of my school's ""unofficial"" student community pages on Instagram. A few students I know are being badly bullied through some very inappropriate pages. 

By accident, I ran across a short video from a student captioned ""sneaking into a freshmen class to mess with the sub!""... And I recognized it as being from a class that gave me pure hell a few months ago. I turned the sound on and recognized my voice in the background. I am a deeply unpopular individual with the student body. I enforce the mask mandate and tell people they cannot hang out in the bathrooms. It has crossed my mind that I probably cross a few Snapchat stories, but now I am worried about the kids likely photographing or taking video of me for pranks.

It's not all my students, obviously. None of my AP, honors, or even level 2 kids would dream of this. I hear from other teachers, counselors,  and admin how many of my students love me and my classes. I try to hold onto that.

While my students are doing well from a data/grades standpoint, I will be the first to admit that I'm in ""survival mode"" and am not differentiating instruction a ton as far as doing a lot of different or new activities. I'm sort of sticking to the basics and getting through a week or even day at a time.

Lord knows I could use some support, but I'm fluent in administrative/managerial speak, so I'm pretty sure I know where this is headed. 

Had my meeting today, and got my ""support"": a more detailed lesson plan template to be used and submitted more frequently, an update to my professional development plan that will involve admin choosing my goals for the rest of the semester, and a TBD number of meetings with our district's instructional coach. This is all to change the fact that I'm not utilizing my instructional time appropriately, and that students aren't learning or being properly prepared for assessments. 

What I did not get was a chance explain or defend myself. Well, to be fair, at the end of the 20 minute meeting I was asked if I have any questions, and I could have used that time to do so. But, like...would there have been a point? We (school/district/state/country) are basically pretending COVID is over. Safety protocols are a joke. No one above the teacher level is acknowledging that we're essentially back to hybrid learning, since we all have at least a few students per class who are out sick or quarantining. Expectations and demands on us are not only not staying the same, they're *increasing.* And for what? We got a couple percent raise in this year's state budget, so there's that.

1642700113.0,"Teachers punching kids, my controversial (?) take.","If you're not aware of it, there was a video posted a little while ago where a kid is being terrible, the teacher reaches a breaking point, and the teacher swings.

*Tldr at bottom*

Down near the bottom of that thread, you'll find my comments. Which I acknowledge were poorly phrased, and you'll see they got a lot of downvotes. I want to take a second to express myself better, and hopefully have a discussion, if people still disagree with me and want to downvote that's cool I'll eat it.

When we see a teacher taking a swing at a kid, and all we do is condemn the teacher or applaud the teacher, we're missing the chance for a good conversation. It should go without saying that it is almost never appropriate for an adult to hit a kid.

Just in case it's not clear, the teacher should not have hit the kid.

With that said, I don't think we can just condemn the teacher and walk away. We have to condemn the systemic failings that put the teacher in that situation in the first place. Because it's easy to judge from the other side of a keyboard. But every single person has a breaking point.

I am not a teacher right now, specifically because I knew it was not good for me to be somewhere where I was going to have to dance on that line.


**Back to the controversial thought.**

In America we have primary positions where we expect people to deal with the public as an authority. Teachers, and cops. I'm going to leave out my political opinions on cops, because I don't think it's worthwhile in this discussion, but I will simply say that de-escalation should play a much higher role, and violence a much smaller role, in policing.

Regardless, cops have a pretty big tool belt when it comes to carrying out their objectives, maintaining their authority, and trying to feel safe. Regardless of abuse, that's not the topic, there are a lot of tools.

What tools do teachers get? Ask nicely? Call the office and hope they come down?

And as a cop, you're not in a high stress situation from the moment you clock into the moment you clock out. Even on the worst beat, you've got a partner, you can go back and hang out in your car for a little bit, back up is always waiting to come. It's not you on the streets by yourself for 8 hours straight with pretty much no help.

You remind me of the horrors I used to hear in the teacher's lounge. Teachers saying horrible things about their students in their back. What the fuck was wrong with them? And with some of you?

Now I understand it probably was not a coincidence that I was the **only** teacher in the whole school that had a great relationship with the students, with my classes always being kind-of-quiet, never losing my composure... and that I was the only one who seemed to respect the students as actual people.

Being a teacher suck, I get it. That's why I left, I don´t want to babysit 30+ teens at once on minimum wage. But what happened to you all that you think it's okay to **sucker-punch a kid in the face** ? What's the fucking excuse? Because a literal KID was MEAN to you? Go to fucking therapy instead!

1642655762.0,First Year Teacher and I Already Believe I'm a Terrible Instructor and Ready to Leave,"Hey everyone,

I apologize for the long rant I am about to make. I just feel so lost and need some advice on job opportunities. Please skip to the end if need be. I just need to get my thoughts out somewhere.

As the title states, I am a new teacher who is teaching English, and I never had the opportunity to student teach before the pandemic hit. Got a job across the state after finishing my master's in theater (English BA), and I was so excited to be pursuing my desired career and not living off unemployment looking for anything to survive. The salary is the best I have made in my life so far (late 20s for reference), which is sad, yet I thought it was the start to a wonderful stage in my life to begin helping out kids and doing my best to be an effective instructor...that is up until now. 

I.feel.awful. I am a terrible teacher. No one prepared me for what things would be like. I had an understanding that the first year or two may be rough, yet not like this. I know I am going to make many mistakes, yet didn't expect to receive such backlash from students and parents, and I feel so worthless. While my admin and fellow teachers are supportive and say this will pass and to just survive, I feel like I have been thrown to the wolves. No resources or guidance given to me on what to teach, and every unit and lesson plan I make is on the fly. Every day I am just wondering how a lesson or unit will go that I can create on my off time, since my planning periods are busy covering for teachers out from covid. Some days are great, and many other days the lessons don't work. That's fine, it's part of the growing pains right? That's what I want to believe...I want to believe I am doing the best I can with the hand I have been dealt, yet still feel like a joke of a teacher.

The kids overall are just disrespectful and nasty to me. I feel like I am failing them, yet I am trying so hard and learning as well. Even with how they treat me, I care about their education and want them all to be successful. Some are wonderful and enjoy the theatrical display I put on as I pretend I am not screaming internally and teach them what I can, yet it is exhausting. My mental health has plummeted. I dread going to work or having to talk with my students.

 I let teenagers get to me as they give me lip and don't pay attention or refuse to do work...and these are honors students. They view any new teacher as inferior and not worth their time. Even when they haven't been taught a good amount over the last few years, like writing a properly formatted essay...they just don't follow and refuse to believe I know what I am talking about...and when I don't give them As because they did it wrong or was written poorly? Parents come lashing out because I am a problem teacher. Their child never fails, so it's my fault they are. How dare I not give them an A like others do. The ones who don't even turn it in? Admin says give them a 50 at best. Don't give Fs otherwise. Never a 0.

I try my best to be patient with them and not lose my cool, because it's not professional or right to raise my voice in a mean way or return the nasty behavior. On the days where I can get students to follow along and learn, I feel a little better about myself...until the moment I make one tiny mistake, and I am jumped on. As for admin helping me with behavior? A slap on the wrist for that kid being rude and they are fine as they don't want to ""upset the parents"". 

I feel helpless. Does it get better? Did I pick the worst time to jump in as a new teacher during a pandemic? Or is this the reality and future of education in the US? Am I just bad at this job? I am just so unhappy and tearing myself apart mentally and it's affecting my life outside and my personal relationships. 

To all of the teachers who have had more years of experience and go through this; I absolutely respect you. I feel weak and mentally soft for feeling this way after only five months. I don't know how many of you are still doing this. The only reason why I feel motivated to even go to work is because I feel like I have no other way to get a job with a reasonable income. 

Should I just quit? I don't even know what jobs a new English teacher with minimal experience in education could do. I have mostly been a student before this. I just feel so lost and defeated and I feel terrible writing this. For those who have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my rant. I am already considering finding a therapist to help me out with my depressed state. I just need to know what routes to even consider.

The parent of the aggressor is apparently pushing this because their child said I threw something at him, which definitely did not happen. There were no security cameras in place to record anything and no other adults around, just a class full of kids, so it’s my word against the (one) kid’s. These were younger students but old enough to seriously hurt one another, something which I have seen happen and have prevented on many occasions. So anyway, apparently I’m going to be written up.

1643106953.0,How to escape from Teaching to Tech: an easy guide,"##Why?

- High employment
- Huge salaries
- Really not so hard
- Often can work remote
- Your boss HAVE TO make you happy because you can just quit

##Which industry?

- Video games, software development, webdev...
- Webdev currently a very good choice, lots of demand, good work condition, high salaries. I only know webdev, so I will talk here about webdev.

##Is it easy?

Nothing worth doing is really easy. It is a LOT of work, because there are a **lot** of things to learn. It can be a very pleasant experience depending on your situation and interests, or it can be not for you at all.

This article will try to list everything that can help you or impede you. If you have a lot of positive points, you should definitely do it. If you don't, then maybe not.

##Which skills are needed?

- Passion for programming: huge advantage, but not mandatory.
- Ability to sit in front of a screen for long times (or stand, you WILL invest in a standing desk eventually)
- Talent: Some people learn faster than others. Some people start with an affinity for computer logic. You don't need talent to succeed, but talent will help you achieve your goals faster.

##Can anyone do it?

- Some people can't learn programming at a decent pace.
- Most people can succeed in a couple years.
- Some people can succeed in a very short time (6 months to a year)

Teachers are often bright people, so most of you should be in 2nd or even 3rd category.

ADHD/Autistic people usually succeed very well from what I've seen (conditions apply).

Note: these estimations are assuming you are in the ""unemployed"" category. If you work full-time on the side, it can be much longer.

##Personal advantages:

- You have a network of programmers around you (friends, family)
- Non-native English speakers: you speak English fluently

##Personal disadvantages:

- You have kids. It's already a lot of work, a lot of pressure, and a lot of interruptions while you study. Still possible, but it makes it harder.

##How to learn?

- Self-taught works: online MOOCs and courses.
- Paid bootcamps: Sometimes bad. Sometimes very expensive. Sometimes great. Need to check what they're teaching, ""real"" reviews from alumni, etc.
- 42 free coding school: In Paris and Silicon valley (maybe other places). I recommend it if you can get past the entrance exam. Don't need to finish the full 3-years, you can leave after one.

Other considerations: You need to work on Unix for most technologies, so either install Linux, or if you have too much money and you don't hate apple then buy a mac.

Additionally, you should balance your time between practicing and learning. Practicing should go first, until you're blocked, then it's time to learn. Once you know enough to unblock you, go back to practicing.

##What to learn?

Full guides here: [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/)
Frontend is a good choice for starters and a good entry to the job. You can also aim to enter as backend or fullstack, but you need some frontend knowledge anyway.

The guides are a good resource, but you should also check where you live/where you WANT to live and see what's the most sought after there.

##When to learn?

- While working on the side (so on evenings, weekends): Difficult, but might be doable. Might take a much longer time.
- Quitting your job to study: Much easier, but you need to be able to support yourself financially.

##Timeline for self-taught webdev

To learn a new technology, you usually start with lessons and short exercises (i.e on [websites like this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)). Then I would advise to build a decent-size project to really be sure you're past tutorial hell (see below). This project should take at least a couple week of full-time work.

Then keep learning highly researched new technologies. When you know ""enough"", start looking for a job. ""Enough"" might be HTML/CSS/Javascript + React + other stuff like Git (see guides).

While you're actively looking for a job, keep working on personal projects.

Finally, know that ""writing working code"" is not enough, you need to produce Enterprise-grade code. Read about ""Best practices"". Try to find a mentor to guide you on this vast topic.

##What are the biggest challenges?

- Tutorial hell: when you are able to do ""coding exercises"", very small projects, small web pages, but are unable to start a real project which scales in complexity. No easy solution for this except practice, practice, practice.

- First job: The first job is the hardest to get. The reason is that rookie developers actually cost more to a company than they bring, and once they start working efficiently they often leave for a better job. So companies have little incentive to hire you out fresh out of school.

Once you are past 2 years experience as a developer, [you are worth more than money](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/companies-worry-more-about-access-to-software-developers-than-capital.html) and will never be hungry again.

1697257011.0,My age is impacting my authority?,"Hello! I’m a 20yr old female dance teacher who is having trouble garnering respect from my students, fellow dancers, and some fellow teachers. For some context my fellow dancers are around high school age and my students range from 3-10yrs old. I also happen to default to saying “yes” when it comes to helping others in my free time, I am diagnosed with autism (the faculty are aware) and I have taught in a public school and in a ballet company. 

I believe that my age is impacting my authority because a parent of a student who was acting out in class said that I looked like a, “big sister” instead of a teacher. I have also been talked down to by the high school dancers because I am supposedly too old to be allowed to sit somewhere even if I got there first or I have seniority in the company. However, these same dancers would make way for other dancers my age with the same skills if they happen to guest for our company. I was also kinda forced to massage one of the senior eachers because I was not busy. They did not stop to ask if I was ok with it. 

I have been in therapy and am now learning that people can take advantage of you, but I want to develop authority at least equal to my position in the school. I have been working on declining things that I am not interested in doing, but I still have trouble with saying “no” in the moment. Is there any way to change my reputation at my school? It’s pretty abysmal right now, but I would like to change how people treat me for the better.

1695876265.0,Tonight I was scolded by a parent for telling their kid to quiet down.,"I am a high school music teacher who often takes students to events after school. Tonight we were on a bus and the students were very exuberant,  talking and laughing loudly.  One girl in particular had a very high pitched -ear piercing laugh which was bothering our bus driver who asked her to stop. The kids ignored the bus driver, so I stepped in calling the girl’s name and asked her to quiet down. (Loudly in order to be heard over the commotion)

As parents often come to these events, the parent s of the loud girl approached me very upset that I had yelled at their child in front of a bus full of students which embarrassed her. They also felt the need to explain to me that their daughter has a loud voice and I should understand that she can’t control it. 

So, I’m not supposed to control a situation where a child’s high pitched laugh is distracting a bus  driver in fear that I might embarrass the kid? How does this make sense?

I work for a Montessori school for preschoolers as an assistant and have been there for almost a year. We have a very high turnover rate for assistants cause we were always understaffed and people leave constantly. I’ve given my 2 week notice and was asked to stay one more week as we have some staff that are out for vacation. I ended up agreeing cause I felt bad and wanted to show how dedicated I am even if I’m leaving. Side note, I personally feel like the parents trust me more than the newer assistants since I’ve been there longer than then. So some parents I feel like are comfortable talking to me about their child’s day or progress. The other day I was called by my assistant director and director to the office, saying that a parent “complained” that I made their child seem like they are terrible or bad… and a couple days before I was talking to that same parent informing her that I’ll be leaving and of course she was saying that it’s sad for them to see me go. I also was telling her that I will miss working with her kid since her kid is in preschool and I was assigned for toddlers that week I am originally for preschool and hated that they’ve put me in toddlers since I’ve never worked with toddlers on top of that I told them that I would like to keep my 9-5 schedule and I have communicated to them long time ago that I prefer not to close but still they’ve put me on a closing shift. She made a sly comment saying “ugh I wouldn’t want to be in toddlers, I think I can be with infants” since I felt like we were in a joking kind of conversation I responded to her jokingly “don’t be fooled”(about the infants) apparently the same parent mentioned this to my director and was pretty much told by my director and asst. director to avoid parents at all costs and to shut up and just be very positive. side not our previous lead teacher called cps and licensing on this place. There are so much other dramas that went on but it’s too long to add here.Now I feel awful since all I just care about their child but don’t meant anything by it. But I dislike working at this place and I’m really unhappy which is why I’m leaving. I’m so traumatized after I was called into the office for this reason. I feel even worse that I’m on my last week and I feel so attacked. This place has caused me so much anxiety all throughout my stay. I guess my unhappiness is reflecting on the way I communicate?  I’m really sad about this whole thing and I feel like I cannot show my face to them anymore. Also cause I feel so betrayed and that they don’t have my back after all the crappy ways they’ve treated me. I don’t know what to feel and think anymore.

During my first few years, I hopped around a bit: I taught in a small CA Catholic middle school, a rural Virginia middle school, a small CA private secular K-8 school. Then I moved to NYC and I taught at a large Title 1 high school NYC closed down, a new small Title 1 grades 6-12 NYC public school (aftermath of the closing down) for 9 years. I then moved South and taught in Maryland at two charter schools, one located in DC. I then took a job at a very large (academically) high performing suburban Maryland high school. All have their strengths and weaknesses, upsides and downsides. If you are someone who craves meaning and seeing a relatively immediate positive impact on others as I do, I advise frustrated teachers to try a variety of settings and, if you can, and move when things get stale before giving up on the profession completely. Also, don't be afraid to switch subjects. I taught math at the private schools, got bored, and then got certified in English. Middle school kids were driving me crazy so I picked up an ESOL license through Praxis, allowing me to teach any grade. Later I did the same with social studies. This helped me get away from the massive amounts of grading. Happy now although I sometimes miss my colleagues and the family-like environment from the high pressure Title 1 schools.

This mean that for the first time since I've been working at this school I left with no clue of what I might be teaching next year and absolutely no idea as to who I'll be working with in my direct chain of command.  

A friend of mine put up a post about all the changes he wants to make to improve himself and his school year this year.  I commented telling them I was anxious because of the information above.  That's when I learned a few things.  1) They have a teacher rat on their FB.  2) My fears about this principal which had been subsided after their being here for two years were actually founded. 3) Having anxiety is a negative reflection of the school and a violation of social media policy (WTF!!!!).

So, obviously someone had to tell the principal what I commented because per social media policy both our accounts are friends only and the principal isn't a friend on either account.  So, I get a call from the principal berating me for having anxiety about the year.  Accusing me of being ungrateful because they had fended off issues and defended me as a teacher last year (um as long as I'm not doing anything wrong isn't that their job?).  The icing on the cake though was their telling me that if I have anxiety, I should be going to a therapist to fix my problems not sharing them with coworkers because they can't be on any assistance to my mental health.",TeacherReality

Everyone is stressed, off sick, injured from pupil assault. Ya know. Normal. 

Workload has been ratcheted up constantly because the school appointed some middle leaders from the money they don't seem to have. They need to justify their position so they've been making paperwork exercises. 

Teachers. Classic teachers. Fucking teachers. 

Meeting starts. We are told we will be creating a 900/1000 word planning document every half term based off *planning that is already online*. Yes. So we're going to copy and paste the content into a document, add some word soup and promises of differentiation that will probably not happen. 

Teachers all nodding. The same teachers who complain about workload and understand there's no time for this. I'm looking around wondering if they've done the translation yet. It roughly translates to 

""hey fuckers, you know that holiday you get to try and rebuild your shattered mental health?... how about we take another day of it off you... because this pointless fucking document HAS to be on the system by 9am on the first day. Not for students. For us""

No one says anything. The cat flap in an elephant house effectiveness senior leaders grin mindlessly knowing more work is being done. That must be good right? Do they wonder how much more work can be ratcheted up? No. Because that would require an understanding of management beyond unrealistic ungrounded mindless aspirations based on falsity.

1686837821.0,Career Advice,"Hi All, 

I work for a large urban district. We are surrounded by smaller suburban districts that do pay significantly more money (with less education requirements for top salaries). Here’s the catch: my district pays significantly more from years 1-10, it’s only after that point where the suburban districts leave my district in their dust.

For example, with a master’s plus 60 credits (or three master’s degrees, or one doctorate), my district’s top base salary is $105k after ten years. A suburban district will pay a base of $125k after 15 years with only a master’s plus 30 credits.

My salary is increasing by $6k starting this summer, but if I went to this suburban district at the equivalent salary step, my income would basically be the same as it was this year. 

So what would you do? Take a pay cut for a decade to reap the higher salary for the second half of your career, or decrease your total career’s earnings by about $300k and stay in the current district?

Thanks!",TeacherReality
1686712632.0,Blackout protest,"So... Elephant in the room: Why hasn't
r/TeacherReality joined the Reddit protest when so many adjacent subs have? The mod team hasn't spoken about it, so this is just me talking. But there is stuff worth saying.

First and foremost reason, in my mind, is that the community has not called for it. The first meta thread about the protest on the sub was posted today. If/when the community calls for action, the community will decide and we moderators will follow. What ""decided"" looks like in a site filled with bots and alts is a bit hard to nail down, but the decision rests with the community, not its moderators.

Second, I mod a few subs, one of which has joined the protests (the others are too small for it to be much impact either way). I would say that the purpose of *that* sub is entertainment, which is not the reason *this* sub exists. 

Our primary purpose is to offer a place for teachers to receive support in the tough choice many make to leave the profession. Summer is the time when many make that choice. When someone leaves their school, they may be leaving their support system, their friends, and reevaluating much about their life. This is a place to remind them that they still have value (both economic and *human* value). I don't want to shut down that life line just when someone might need it.

I've been teaching for 19 years-- I'm going to keep teaching-- but I've seen too many colleagues and friends broken, by what was the toughest choice they ever faced, for me to pull the rug out from under anyone who needs the help-- even for a moment. There are school admins, HR departments, and even colleagues out there who will make people feel like their humanity and wellbeing is a small price to pay for test scores-- we are a counter narrative to that.

Does that excuse anything Reddit is doing? No. I am personally horrified, especially by the shutdown of apps that provide accessibility where Reddit does not. 

If the sub decided that it was time to go dark, would I press the button? Sure. 

Is that my decision to make? I don't think so.

He is extremely supportive of teachers, he is also certified in ELA and Math and will happily take over a class if needed. He LOVES confrontation (meaning, get an angry parent to calm down), coaches several sports and the students love him. He is the first one in the school and the last one out. This man is so dedicated, a great leader, teacher and colleague. 

Our school has two campuses. The other one is a huge mess and all the middle school teachers threaten to walk out. My principal was asked to intervene and help for a few weeks. And I guess their principal is now gone. 

HR decided to move him to that campus. I am pretty sure he is not happy about that. I know he loves his school and he complained about the other campus a lot. They didn't give him a choice. 

We do not know what the board is going to decide as to who is going to be our principal.

We had a standing meeting last Monday to learn that over the weekend one of our students parents called the police because he found a pistol and AR in the kids bedroom. Upon further investigation admin found out there was a TikTok of this kid showing his buddy the guns in the school bathroom the week before. The day this kid brought them to school he was supposed within the first 32 minutes for flipping off a teacher. Based on his history we believe he intended to use them.

What did admin do? Sent out communication to parents 3 days after telling staff about it but said ""weapon"" even though we clearly knew it was a gun. Also, this situation could have been completely avoided because the kid sold pot gummies on campus the second week of school. He should have been charged with a felony and expelled then. No, we let him stay and be spent 27% of his year causing enough issues to be suspended. The kid that took the video in the bathroom for him? I found his TikTok and he's also a little prick. He thinks he's so tough and cool, his parents also bought him a shotgun for his birthday. Yet another kid that should've been expelled long ago for constant suspensions.

We have 1.5 days left and I feel like every day I go home I'm just thankful to still be alive. This whole event sends the message of: ""we don't care about your safety as long as these kids learn"". I signed a contract in a new district for next year and cannot wait to be out.",TeacherReality
1684463829.0,Positive Reinforcement?,"Positive Reinforcement.

How can you use positive reinforcement on a child who is received many warnings about being mindful about their body and surroundings but still constantly get hurt.  It has been going for 3 weeks.

I got so frustrated that I let the child know that I am scared to take them on summer field trips. If there is a 4th week I will put my foot down and ask one of their parents to go with. But ik for a fact they won't bother to come. They NEVER have.

ANYWAYS

No shock today and with my luck they went home and had a limp but didn't tell staff. And I get a message from mom along with my much now regretted statement of "" I'm scared to take them on field trips."" (Let mom know it was regrettably mentioned)

 I've already noted and know that they get overly excited before the transition to outside or new activites. I ask them to walk to the ""calm couch"" and to show me what relaxed and clam means. (If they are not running they are stomping and angry/screams because I am asking them to relax & calm down and even then the success rate is maybe 65%)
But this morning and my luck, they run to the couch and adds in a head into the wall. 

How do you turn running into the wall a positive reinforcement situation even after many warnings and told what behavior is to be expected? (*** please walk to the calm couch and relax) I've done my part to see what triggers cause these actions but its following through directions and listening isn't going though. 

Maybe I say and do ""I see that you ran into the wall, that's why the direction was to walk. Here is a hug,ice pack and an hour me panic observing to make sure you don't have a concussion"" 

Where do I add the ""rewarding or reinforcing desirable behavior in order to increase the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated in the future""?(google)

SO 

In my response, I told her ""How does after a couple of reminders to *** about being mindful of how our surroundings can affect our body or the choices that we make can affect our body. We can have *** sit next to a teacher for a calm break until *** is ready to try again."" 
 But it's still the same strategy I have used just different places and clearly it's not positive enough. Obviously reminders only can go so far. 


As for ""how is his body awareness"" he walks around and says genitalia terms like its nothing. (Not often and is corrected and told when is and where is the appropriate time to say those terms) He's well aware of what IS where and whats IS there. IM SURE he is aware of his body.",TeacherReality

Yesterday, my district received mass threats to middle schools throughout the district. Parents were advised to speak with their children and student absences were all excused. Here’s where i’m fucking pissed:

We, as their teachers, were not given ANY information. We were not told which schools received a threat (it’s a big district) and we were not told exactly what the threat entailed. We were also NOT encouraged to stay home like students were. they didn’t acknowledge us at all, actually. I was literally sobbing this morning on my way to work because I was so terrified. I said goodbye to my husband, my cats, my best friend and parents, hell I even drafted a goodbye note for my best friend to give my husband “just in case”!!!

Maybe it was stupid of me to not call out immediately, but we live in such a society where I feel BAD for wanting to protect MY OWN LIFE over the lives of other peoples kids that I have no relation to. Don’t get me wrong, I adore my students but I JUST got married. I JUST turned 25 (literally yesterday, got the email at my literal birthday dinner so that was fun /s) I have had unrelated health issues recently that has caused me to miss multiple days so close to the end of this school year and i felt bad calling out when I “didn’t need to” 

My roommate woke up to see me walking out the door sobbing my eyes out and so I told them what was going on and why I was still going in. How I didn’t know which schools were under threat and it was a small chance it was my school since the district was so big so “it will probably be fine” They told me to text my principal and ask if she had more info (this hadn’t even occurred to me, idk why) and she responded that it was in fact our school that was directly under threat. I told her immediately that I was staying home which thankfully she understood and wasn’t upset at all. 

It just PISSED me off that we as teachers got NO INFORMATION. There was nothing communicated that we were under investigation or called out. I had to ASK. Why didn’t they just close the school down?!? I spent the entire day stressed out of my mind and looking at the news every hour to see if there were any updates. We ended up getting a district wide email saying that the poster was arrested and would be charged accordingly, and thank fucking god that nothing happened but what the hell has america come to?!

1677549397.0,"Here's My Experience: I have no one to tell, so I'll tell you.","I need to express what I'm going through somewhere, and this seems like an okay place to do it. I often see people posting here in a rather negative way about students, but to be honest I don't find the students to be what makes this a punishing job. I became a teacher through TFA, so I have only worked in Title I schools. Fights break out, property gets damaged, and students can be generally noisy, mean, and way less mature than society expects, but I find that the way I treat students has a huge influence on how they respond to me. I have noticed at the schools I have worked at that the teachers most likely to complain about how horrible students are happen to be teachers that are mean and sometimes say dehumanizing things to students. They also happen to be teachers who are pretty ""old school"", and don't feel like its worth their time to bother keeping up with best practices in the field.

In short, I'm pretty new at this but student behavior is not something I prioritize as a problem. It may be that I came into teaching as what TFA calls a ""career changer"", and I am bringing my previous experience with me, which has happened to be pretty helpful in the classroom.

What makes this job such a demoralizing and demeaning experience is the school district... well, the system in general. There is just too much about how education works that honestly just seems like a stupid idea. What feels good to say is that the district seems like it's run by idiots.

When I started writing this post, I expected that I would be able to explain some of why I believe this. But now I'm running out of time to write, and I don't even know where to start because it's so overwhelming. I have worked in about two dozen organizations and I have never seen anything approach the level of incompetence and dysfunction that I am observing in this school district, full of people none-the-wiser going about their business as if this stuff was normal.

There are lots of valid criticisms about Teach For America, but one thing that they seem to do well is to expose incoming teachers to the most current practices in teaching, and give you a pretty formidable crash course on theory. One would think that a summer crash course on literacy education and pedagogy is but a humble beginning compared to the experience of education leaders who have a decade or more under the belt. This is what I believed. 

I shit you not, I have come to the slow awareness over my time teaching that the TFA crash course plus my previous work experience and unrelated degree have left me more prepared to do this right off the bat than a lot of people seem like they are after years. I do not feel proud of myself and am not bragging about this. Rather, it's the story of a slow horror that has been making itself known to me. Like, really? How is it that I have a better idea of how to do this than the people whose jobs are allegedly to tell me how to teach?

I have educators in my life that are inspiring, and I admire some public leaders in education as well. Of all the people who have a say over what I am doing (there are about seven *seven* ***SEVEN PEOPLE*** observing my classroom and leaving orders for me---no wait... EIGHT) one. *one.* **ONE OF THEM** is a person who obviously has good leadership skills, builds relationships with students and teachers skillfully, is extremely knowledgeable about teaching practices AND gives amazing feedback. ONE OF THEM, and it's the one that gets bulldozed the most by the others because this person is at the bottom of their hierarchy.

Could be worse. I trust my administrators' intentions and I like them. I've been disappointed by some of their decisions---I don't know what makes them think that asking me to explain my lessons over and over is a more helpful use of time than letting me reflect and come to our coach for feedback (coach with specific and recent experience in my subject area, or admin without experience in this core subject... which is more helpful?), or what makes them think that scolding me (""you better do it!"") is a good way to get the results they want from me when I am a grown-ass adult who is clearly intrinsically motivated to grow in this role. Actually, does anyone really need to be harassed into doing this job? Is it even possible? Who is even left teaching besides people who are stuck waiting for retirement and people who have some good personal reasons to even try it? I think that when they feel harassed and infantilized by their bosses, they decide to just pass it on.

As far as admin are concerned, that job is absurdly hard and overwhelming, but administrators who don't learn to fully trust the people who are working under their authority are just going to make it harder for themselves. That's true in every organization. 

Why my administrators feel that way is because they themselves have to report to a micromanaging hierarchy of people who maybe aren't people's favorite to work with. One would imagine that being a psychopath and sadist is a prerequisite for work in that department. There are so many cooks in the kitchen... I mean, we could totally better use that money to hire coaches and ESE teachers, but my district instead decided to create an out-of-touch, pompous hierarchy. Instead of sending work down the hierarchy, there are FOUR levels of this hierarchy that directly engage with us at the classroom level. They don't say anything---they mostly seem to try to avoid interacting with teachers. But they have opinions. And this entire organization is run according to their opinions. Not policy, not a concrete and transparent set of criteria... just their often inconsistent opinions. So we are left scrambling at the bottom to meet their often different expectations, which are sometimes incompatible with each other.

Their opinions are the worst. They insist that we adopt these awfully lazy teaching practices that they think are good teaching. They think they are rigorous. Putting their ideas to work in my classroom only makes things worse. I did it because I was sure I'd collect data on how it's worse, and I do have some. But now no one is interested in looking at my data. lol.

I teach students in historically poor neighborhoods. The overwhelming majority are from recently immigrated families or African-American families. I have students that have extremely poor self-management skills, short attention spans, and I imagine are neurologically under-stimulated and under-developed. For these students, a lot of scaffolding is important. I cannot simply put a grade-level text and a bunch of multiple choice questions in front of them and hope for the best, or ask them to read independently and shrug if they fall behind. That only works if they value education and are intrinsically motivated themselves. If they don't... well god forbid they appear to have fun in class, or that I spend a necessary amount of time getting them to buy into what I'm teaching so that it actually sticks, or that I give them a little agency so that they are treated like human beings for a while and practice making decisions about their learning. This is exactly what all the relevant experts and sources that I trust say I need to do, but the bureaucracy of child-hating psychopaths is not into it. They have the fewest complaints when what I'm doing looks like test-prep, which let's be honest bores the shit out of me and you, so definitely bores the shit out of my struggling students.

Not all my students are far below grade level. Some of them are at or above grade level. At some of the more highly-regarded schools in my district, their mastery would probably be seen as mediocre. However, relative to other students at my school, these guys are doing their best to aim high. In this group of students, I have students who have unbelievably bad situations at home and have to struggle with difficult family conflicts. They are emotionally affected by these things. Some of them struggle to be motivated. They might be the first English-speaking generation in their family. There are so many students that are driven and gifted. They go through the year barely turning any work in, and then BOOM they turn in something that demonstrates an impressive level of insight and creativity, maybe because they happened to have a good week and were better able to rise to their potential. They would soar so high if we only took notice and helped them overcome the obstacles that are holding them back.

Being responsive to the needs of either of these groups of students, which both make up the majority of my students, is not an important part of teaching according to the useless wastes of public money that have the most influence over what happens to them. When I try to do something to be responsive to my students according to best practices that I can cite, I tend to get reprimanded, called ""outside of the box"" for playing it safe according to science, get called ""rogue"" for letting my relationship with my students and all the data I get from that inform my teaching.

I have never felt as disrespected, demeaned, demoralized as a professional. I have never worked for people so ignorant. Their incessant demands for compliance with their unclear and contradicting instructions (how do you comply successfully with something that contradicts itself, anyway?) are oppressive and just wrong. They are so short on teachers, but I don't think they got the memo on that because they treat us like we are expendable. I already have another career and I am testing the waters through a TFA commitment... why the hell would I want to actually continue working under these conditions? 

If someone paid me to organize AGAINST this bureaucracy of clowns and identify them as the enemy of the people that they are I would take that job.",TeacherReality

1676670729.0,I made my VP cry today,"TLDR: I brought an error to the VPs attention and she responded by not fixing it and crying. 


In my district to handle sub/teacher shortages, teachers cover for absent teachers during their prep periods. We are supposed to have a union negotiated equitable rotation of teachers covering. My school in particular is terrible at it. People on the “leadership” team (deans, counselors, coaches, the vice principal and the principal) and school darlings rarely if ever are covering. 

Recently I complained that the space I’m reaching out of (I am a special education teacher, the only one in my building without their own class room) is being misused and it has become super disruptive to my students.

Since then, I have been covering almost every day and had three prep periods I wasn’t covering during in the past two weeks. 

Yesterday morning when I saw I was covering again, I asked the VP (who as part of her duties is supposed to create these schedules) why I had another coverage as it doesn’t make sense given the rotation. She responded that because of call outs EVERYONE was being used. Looking at the coverage sheet, this was obviously untrue but I let it go because I had stuff to do and I’m not interested in arguing with her.

Today, I sat in my car waiting for the daily coverage schedule to come in through email before going in. When I got it and saw I had lost my prep period again, I checked and made sure there were other people on the same rotation as me available. I already knew from checking yesterday that they should have been ahead of me in the rotation. None of them were covering, none of them had scheduling conflicts. There was no obvious reason it should have been me again. 

So armed with all this, I walked into the building and attempted to talk to my vice principal. I am NOT a confrontational person, and honestly part of why I’m dealing with not having a classroom and being used for coverages so much is because I am a very easy going person at work(I’ve learned my lesson now though). 

So I calmly tell my vice principal “VP, I covered 2nd grade Tuesday, 8th grade yesterday and you have me on the schedule for Kindergarten today. There are other sped teachers who have not had coverages at all this week.” (I had the ok to mention this from these teachers because everyone is aware of this issue and I’ve had all their backs before) 

And my vice principal starts crying and says “I’m sick and I’m here! And principal has said she will pay someone else to make the coverage schedule because I don’t want to do it anymore!” 

She wasn’t yelling but was loud, everyone is looking at us, I didn’t want to lose my shit so I just turned around and walked out of the office. I heard she starting crying more after I left and said “all the sped teachers hate me”

The absolute insanity of this situation is too much. Imagine someone bringing an error you made to your attention and responding by crying and telling them your job is too hard? I still lost my prep. She hasn’t said anything to me since. I’ve interacted with the principal since then and other leadership people who were there and everything was fine.

Idk what I want to do from here. I did talk to my union rep about it, they said they would address it but i am seriously just mind blown by the whole situation.",TeacherReality

I also had a 1h phone chat with HR prior to my hiring and we talked, again, about teacher dress code extensively, tattoos were still not brought up. I feel deceited. 

I just started a new position as an ELA teacher in a charter (secular) middle school. The position has been vacant for nearly 2 years. I am highly qualified and they absolutely love me, they were desperate to hire me and paid my buyout for leaving my previous school.

Today a colleague, who also has a lot of tattoos, told, very nicely, me to cover up my arm tattoo, that it was against school policy.

I was told about dress code, which is slightly stricter than what I am used to, but I have no issues with it. I talked to HR for weeks (it was hard to break my old contract) never the tattoos were mentioned, and I have tattoos on my fingers! Idk if they were completely oblivious to them...

Should I pretend I don't know the rule? Also if I am told to cover them, which is ridiculous, none of my tattoos are offensive, the finger ones are a moon and a sun, the arm one is our local skyline, and the ones that will become visible in the summer are flowers, should I really cover them?

I live in Southern AZ and in August it can be over 115 degrees, I absolutely cannot teach in long sleeves!! And I will probably start coaching soccer, outdoors. 

What are they going to do? Fire a good teacher they had trouble finding and leave the classroom empty until they find replacement again? I'm the only ELA teacher of the entire school.

This is 2023 I don't know a single person my age who is not tattooed, it's absolutely ridiculous.",TeacherReality

1674754162.0,Leaked Video Chats With Inmate BF Caused Vet. Florida Teacher To Resign,"A veteran teacher, Donna Barber was so embarrassed she decided to resign swiftly. She was employed at the Franklin County School District for 30 years and was near retirement. 

Everything in her life was going well— she had a boyfriend who she communicated with very often. Donna Barber’s boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, was an inmate at the local prison. 

Donna Barber and her boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, would often video chat. By the way——-their video chats were steamy. On some occasions, Donna Barber would remove her clothes and participate in explicit conversations while on the job.

Once again, Donna Barber worked in a school with children. I’m not quite sure about the specific age or grade level. However, the inappropriate acts and verbal exchange in the workplace is off limits especially a school setting. 

Since, Lawrence Ray was an inmate he was breaking the rules, too. There’s strict rules that he disobeyed during their frequent calls.

Also, Donna Barber’s actions weren’t criminal as mentioned by the local state attorney. But….. the Franklin County School District began to investigate where her calls took place and the timing which were during school sessions.

According to the online records, Donna Barber was told that the school board would recommend termination. Since, her video chats were leaked to the public-she swiftly resigned. She nearly had a great retirement with pension and full benefits.

1674585850.0,Vent RE reference,"Just have to quickly vent that the first AP I emailed about writing me a reference turned me down. I was an ESL teacher at several inner city Title 1 schools for 3 years. I had to leave over a year ago when my parents were both facing life -threatening health problems, multiple heart attacks and Covid. (I had requested unpaid leave, 4 times, FMLA and board approved, but our system was so overwhelmed that nothing was ever processed, so eventually I had no choice but to resign.)

The nature of being a floater doing pull-out at multiple schools means no one is in a great position to write you a reference.

However, the AP in question was the most recent to observe me and gave me a satisfactory review.

I also spent many extra hours per day at the start of the pandemic helping her contact all families about devices and WiFi hotspots and update complex excel charts for her supervisors and so on. Unpaid, of course, just an extra admin duty I agreed to help with.

I just can’t believe that after all the blood, sweat, and tears I put into that job, plus spending hundreds if not thousands of my own money in supplies, that she can’t cough up a generic reference!

I loved the kids, but I’m regretting ever going above and beyond at that job. It nearly destroyed my health. So glad to be free.., but I need references to get back into teaching, and it would be nice if my admin would step up just a bit!

Anyone else in this boat??

I have 5 years of public school teaching experience (the most recent 3 years at a cluster of Title 1 schools from hell), 11 years of community college teaching experience, and 2 years of private school ESL teaching experience.

1674102926.0,A student stole $40 from me 6 weeks ago. Shouldn’t the school reimburse me?,"It’s not even a question that he stole it. I had three twenties folded together in my pocket, and when I took my keys out, they dropped on the floor. As I was bending over to pick them up, the student I was talking to (14) bent over to pick them up first. I thought, “That’s awfully nice of him, picking up something for a man in his 50s!” But, no. He goes, “Finder’s keepers!” then walked out into the hall. 

I said, “Ha, ha. Very funny. Please give me back my money,” but he only handed me $20. I said, “What about the other $40?” He said there wasn’t any more, then turned around and put the $40 in his underwear. Because he had gone into the hall, we got very clear security footage of him doing that, so the dean, my boss and I got his mom on speaker and we all pleaded with him to hand it over. He refused. After about 10 minutes, I went back to class because I had work to do. As I was leaving, my boss said, “Sorry that happened to you.”

They suspended him for the remaining two hours of the day, but he refused to leave, meaning he got to spend the day in the building without going to class, which is what he does all the time, anyway. So, essentially he faced no consequence. During that time, he admitted to the dean that he stole it but couldn’t give it back because he “lost” it.

At his re-entry meeting, we again tried and failed to get my money back. He says his mom told him she would have done the same thing which I totally believe because I never even got an apology from her, much less the money her kid stole. The dean has been advocating for me to get reimbursed but gotten nowhere. I also asked the principal and didn’t even get a response. 

So, I put in my two weeks. I don’t have another job lined up and probably won’t go back into education, but fuck that. Seventeen years experience as a special ed teacher, an MA, and certifications in ELA and Social Studies / History, but they’re willing to throw that away for $40. I guess a job requirement for teaching now is a willingness to be robbed? I also just can’t teach this child any more because every time he wants something from me, all I can think is, “Oh, you want a pencil? Use the $40 you stole from me to buy a whole box.”",TeacherReality

Unfortunately, the district doesn't provide Sped teachers access to their online curriculum, and tell them to 'develop their own'. They also ignore IEP's and refuse to provide paras, which when they exist are paid $25,000. 

This, of course would be possible if $ was spent on lots of Teacherpayteacher worksheets, or if the teachers were professors at top schools with lots of money and help from interns. When I tweeted to the superintendent that he should rethink this issue, I was blocked from his official account.

1673817358.0,feeling horribly guilty for leaving my current school for another one,"I'm currently working for an alternative high school for at risk students. I want to leave because of ridiculous expectations from the corporates and the lack of community/spirit (I like most of my colleagues, but they are definitely not my friends and some colleagues really do make my days difficult). I am underpaid for my qualifications, our health plan is a patchwork of ridiculous plans that no doctor ever understands so I spend ALL of my lunch breaks on the phone with various providers to try to get simple doctor's visits covered. I have no retirement plan and I just arrived to the US with no saving and no plan for retirement. I keep getting undermined by corporates, colleagues can't put on their left sock on without me despite their seniority in the school (I've only been with them for a year and a half), more and more busy work with no real goal or growth out of them. Because of low enrollment I am incredibly bored. We also only have winter break, no fall or spring break. They often give holidays to the kids but make us come to school all day to ""plan"". No team building, we don't even have a break room, just. Meeting room with no window that happens to have a fridge and microwave. I spend my lunch breaks in my car!

So I have so many reasons to leave. But I feel so guilty, and I'll miss my students so much, because I do really love my students, they are the best part of the job. I feel guilty I am leaving a school that currently can't function without me. But at the same time I'm going to a school that needs me even more!

The new school has teachers my own age, happy students, spirit and community. It has a retirement plan and a real health insurance to offer as well as gas stipends, and more pay. AND I'll be able to put my daughter in pre-k there which will save me at least 10k!!!!! My days will be shorter. At the moment I only get 20min a day with my daughter, in the new school I would get an entire afternoon with her nearly everyday. And I can tutor for $25/h whenever I want which is really nice and I would still be home earlier than I am now.

So many reasons to be happy, and leave my current school behind. But the amount of backlash I am about the receive when I announce my departure, I'm also not giving notice as I am in an at will state and the school will withhold my last paycheck according to my contract (f them I'm not going to work for free!) so I will literally be gone overnight. And the disappointment of my students who are fragile teenagers who look up to me and who I absolutely adore... Urgh

In my decade of education I have had students who have experienced essentially every type of trauma you can imagine. 1 of my elementary students was murdered by his mother’s boyfriend. A 9 year old committed suicide. And another drowned in his bathtub after being drugged by his mother and then left unattended. 

I was hospitalized twice for injuries inflicted on me by students. I was told by my principal that getting a concussion from being head butted by a student was a REASONABLE EXPECTATION of my job. 

I had a complete mental breakdown a few months ago. I went through a severe bout with anxiety and depression and had to choose between my well-being or this job.

And here’s the kicker- I gave this job everything I had until I completely fell apart. When I had to resign because my physical and mental health were at serious risk, my principal didn’t even bother to respond to my resignation and just sent out an email to the staff about the logistics of covering my caseload. We are all completely indispensable. 

I honestly can’t believe I got out. A huge weight has been lifted, and this is the happiest I’ve been in years. I’m back to being myself. I’m back to being fun and happy.

1673367862.0,How to maintain order in my classroom when there's no support from admin?,"I'll be honest, guys.  I'm trying to leave this profession as quickly as possible.  I'm miserable.  My (middle) school is in complete disarray after a series of scandals, firings, quittings, and restructuring.  I won't get into it all here, but the result is that we're overcrowded, understaffed, dealing with an inexperienced new admin staff who create insane policies, and pure chaos from the students: daily fights, drugs, sex acts, etc. In the meantime, until I can make the switch, I'm just trying to survive.

The two biggest problems are lack of motivation/work completion and behaviors.  The first problem can be traced to a lot of things like COVID and lower standards, but perhaps the greatest cause is our school-wide policy of having to accept late work with no penalty until the end of the quarter.  I just had a student, who for the past quarter has screwed around and turned in nothing, email me a list of 10 assignments she completed, which I am forced to accept, and her grade went from a D- to a B+.  This leads to my nearly 200 students all being able to treat the entire school day as free time, then put in maybe 4 hours of effort at the end of the quarter and pass.

The second problem is bolstered by the first as well as other factors, but the result is that our admin is so overwhelmed dealing with high profile incidents, that absolutely nothing happens when a student has a minor infraction.  Dress code, talking over the teacher, food, cell phones, and games in class.  I could spend my entire day writing referrals (we don't have the authority as teachers to administer any other consequence such as a detention), but most of these referrals are ignored by admin or result in a quick 2-minute office lecture and then back to class.  Those who return to class stride in triumphantly and are admired by their peers.  Students show each other their behavior logs as a badge of honor.

What I'm left with is 6 periods a day, each over 30 students, who ignore everything I say, talk non-stop, get up and move around the room at will, sitting wherever they want, texting, throwing things, hitting each other, screaming, and me, trying hard to pretend that anyone is listening to me talk about metamorphic rocks.  Verbal warnings do nothing. Yelling does nothing. Writing kids up only encourages them.  When a parent finally concerns themselves with a student's grade, I get an email from said student listing all the assignments I should have forgotten about month's ago that I now have to spend time searching for online and grade.

What can I do to weather this storm until I can get out?  Is there any hope of having an effective seating chart and keeping kids in their assigned seats? Once again, I've spent hours upon hours writing behavior logs and referrals and speaking to admin about the problems with no success.  What can I do on my own, when there are no policies in place to support me, so that I don't feel like a prison guard who's just trying keep students' hands off each other and maintain my sanity.

I have a newish student who has been with me for a month. He is in my “reminder” category; he’s never had an accident and he will go, if needed, when I ask. 

Our sessions are 3 hours long, and I do “potty time” during centers, which is about halfway through our session. 

I asked this student if he needed to use the bathroom, and he said, “no.” Okay. 

30 minutes later, we do our second circle. He was dry at this time. 
Second circle is 20 minutes long, and parents pick up at the end. 

His mom was 10 minutes late. A few minutes later, she violently knocks on my door. When I opened it, she yelled at me because he was “soaking wet.” I told he that he was dry when circle started, and she asked how long ago that was (at this time, 30 minutes). 

Then she yelled that if it ever happens again, he won’t be coming back, and stomped away. 

I went back in and noticed a wet spot on the circle carpet.

Over the the last two years 16 people have either quit or transferred. Her and I got into a disagreement a few weeks ago due to the way she spoke to me in front of some kids and since then she has not liked me. Anyway, I was hired to be an EA in a resource room, due to the obvious nature of the job, before and during my interview (and several times after) I disclosed how I do not feel comfortable working with children who have some form of autistic spectrum disorder, of course it has nothing to do with a prejudice of any kind, just knowing myself I do not work well with individuals such as that. I was told it wouldn’t be a problem and my place in the resource room would center around some of the kids who struggle behaviorally. Well there is a child with autism who is on the case load and he requires an aid with him, the aid he originally had continuously called off and administration would have me to be his one-on-one aid. I reminded them of my disclosure but helped anyway because I am a team player. Two weeks ago they fired his aid and I agreed to help until the board could approve a new hire to take over. Last week they told the intervention specialist they were changing the way her room was ran, hiring a new EA to help her and changed my schedule to be his full time aid without talking to me at all.

Educators will be holding rallies on Saturday, first at 1 p.m. at Haverhill City Hall and then at 4 p.m. at Malden City Hall.

The HEA and MEA released the following joint statement:

“It is no coincidence that the educators in both Haverhill and Malden took votes today to authorize strikes if their respective contracts are not settled before Monday. Several unions representing thousands of educators in communities north of Boston meet regularly to discuss our working conditions, which are our students’ learning conditions. The educators in Haverhill and Malden have been working without contracts. The respective unions have made numerous proposals to address staffing shortages, racial and social justice, safety in schools, adequate time for educators to prepare and collaborate, and wages that have been chronically suppressed. The school committees in both communities are showing no interest in addressing needs we see as critical to our students’ success.

“We are saying enough is enough. Our students deserve better, our communities deserve better, and we deserve better.

“We acknowledge the disruption our strikes can cause. But we can no longer in good conscience see our students receive less than they deserve and for educators to be continually disrespected as professionals. We are ready to bargain any time to settle these contracts. Our respective school committees have the power and authority to avert these actions.”",TeacherReality
1665643908.0,Needing some advice and a rant,"Hi guys. Discovering this subreddit has been therapeutic.

I’m a first year ECT and 5 weeks in I already feel like I’m sinking. The school I’m at has a very intensive marking policy. All books marked and an assessment competed, marked and feedback given every three weeks (so twice a half term). Ive got 10 class groups so you can do the maths here…I’ve been staying up until 11 o clock two or three weeknights every week trying to get through it and I’m already not staying ahead. I got quite sick last week, and although the change of weather of course played a part I also think it was spurred on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. 

Yesterday I got pulled in by a member of SLT as a complaint that I hadn’t marked one of my student’s books. I had already marked that class’s books but the student but have been absent when I took them up. Half way through the conversation I felt like I couldn’t even hear what they were saying to me and I had a really strong urge to just leave the building.

I feel like I’ve already checked out mentally and I don’t want to stay in this job. I know it’s really bad to leave a teaching position mid year, but I truly think I could see myself having a breakdown if I stay.

If I left, I was thinking I could do supply work until my lease is up on my apartment. Or even just find work in a cafe.

1665355055.0,"Going on my second year, and I’m feeling overwhelmed to the breaking point.","Hello all,

This is going to be my second year of teaching, and I just don’t know how to handle all of what is being piled onto my plate. I know this is what I signed up for, but I’m starting to feel depressed and hopeless. I’m not looking for any advice, I just want to let out what I’ve been holding in for some time.

For a little background, I started off teaching at am elementary school near the city, and I ended up having to quit mid-year right before Christmas break because I couldn’t handle teaching at that particular school anymore. I loved my kids, but I had two that needed a lot of extra supports due to special needs and behaviors that I couldn’t provide, and neither had a para to help them while I taught. I ended up getting assaulted by one of my more challenging students, and my cries for help fell on deaf ears, so I left. It was so bad there that I ended up being on a heart monitor because I was so stressed.

I’m at a better school now, but because I left halfway through, I’m behind on mandatory LETRS training, and I feel like the pressure keeps building every single day. Every week something new is piled onto our plates and no one asks “What can we do to help you?” Or asks what they can take away from us. I spend my one hour of planning during the day grading and talking to parents and lesson planning, but more often than not I’ll have to stop because we have ten other different self-directed PDs to complete by a certain deadline. Not to mention we have an entirely new curriculum, are fumbling through it at best, and are of course dealing with behaviors that have only worsened since the pandemic. I know this is common, but I feel so burnt out and alone. I try my best to create boundaries so that I don’t work at home or on weekends, but that means I’ll be at the school until five or six. 

I just feel like breaking down and crying. I feel like I can’t even give my loved ones any attention because of my job. My boyfriend lives in another state and we are both so tired we hardly have but one call a week, I haven’t seen any of my friends in months, and my cat that I’ve had for 14 years has cancer and is dying and I feel like I don’t even have the time or energy to sit with my sadness about that. I also have lost all ability to organize and be productive. My memory gets worse and worse each day and I feel like an idiot when I forget due dates and deadlines. I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD but it is taking forever to find a doctor who will actually get me the help I need, and I feel desperate.

My plate is broken. It can’t hold anything. I want nothing more than to just teach and love my kids, but inside I feel like the whole world is caving in on me. I’m trying my best every day, but sometimes my best is just getting out of bed every morning.",TeacherReality

1664899844.0,I thought I had a great job at a great school until..,"So, I posted this as a comment to somebody’s post about admin treating them poorly but I’ve wanted to make it into a post as I’m still having trouble making sense of what happened. 

I am an educator who’s been in the field for over ten years. I’m currently getting my MA in Early Childhood Education, as this is what I teach in. I’ve been teaching preschool for the past five years and have been working at one school in particular. Last year, my supervisor left and I was asked to step up in her place. I had no prior training or experience running a preschool but I worked tirelessly with my admin day in and day out to create curriculum, build a community, maintain safety in the classrooms, and make sure the kids were well taken care of. I had built great relationships with families over the years and taught their children as well as the siblings. I was teaching a preschool 3s class and I even had a parent call to make sure I would be teaching it the following school year (this year). Since that was my class, I told her yes and she gladly told other parents who then enrolled their kids to stay in the program and continue in my class. 

During the school year I had a lot of problems with staff because most of the teachers I worked with were not teachers but more so looking for part time gigs. I heard a lot of, “well I don’t get paid enough for this shit” or “this is toddler school so it means nothing.” I also had issues with asking them to sanitize during a freakin pandemic. You would have thought I was the supervisor from hell if you asked them but I was the first director of that school that never made teachers feel guilty for calling out and told them they needed to put themselves first. I treated them like humans. I worked very closely with a teacher who was my assistant one year and then became my second in command once I stepped up. We had a great relationship until we learned she had been lying about being in grad school. Not only was this against the law, and her contract, but management didn’t want to get rid of her mid year in fear of the parents reactions.  As the months went on the lies piled up. From little white lies about prepping materials to lying about things such as being pregnant and getting surgery. I felt she was a liability but nobody took me seriously.

After such a trying and mentally exhausting year, I decided to take the summer off and return in the fall. I work at a private school so summers were not paid but you could work at the camp there. Anyways, as I was preparing to go back to the classroom, it was decided that somebody who was more qualified to be director would take over my responsibilities, and being in grad school at the time, I was ok with this. My management told me I should be focusing on grad school, which they were paying for and said I needed my masters in order to grow there. 

Fast forward to the end of summer, I tell them I got approved for student teaching and would be out of the classroom one day a week in a school my grad school placed me in. It was not up to me and I couldn’t do it at my work site. 
Once that was said, they told me I “wouldn’t be happy returning” and that they needed someone full time in the classroom even though it would only be for one semester AND they would have the staff to cover the one three hour shift a week when I wasn’t there. I figured out that once they realized they could use my salary to hire more shitty teachers as bodies, they decided they didn’t need me anymore. I rarely pat myself on the back but I did everything for them and I was honestly a model teacher. Even when parents called them angrily after hearing I wasn’t returning, they still didn’t seem to budge. 

All I wanted was to continue teaching the 3s class and as an even bigger slap in the face, they ended up giving my class to the teacher that had been lying to everyone all year. 

Basically, I’m writing this because I’ve been losing sleep over it and I’m so angry at them for kicking me to the curb. I did EVERYTHING for them. I kept a school open during Covid. I wrote their entire curriculum. I stayed up late at night with my Cricut machine making stickers and prepping activities for my kids on the regular. I built incredible relationships with families, but, I guess it wasn’t good enough? I’m still in grad school but now I’m second guessing everything. Do I even want to do this anymore? Am I a good enough teacher? I still feel so broken about it and it’s been a month now. 

Truly, I’d love to enter the field of education policy one day so I can work for the true MVPs, the mother fucking teachers. We deserve more than management could ever understand and it’s just..

So. 
Damn. 
Frustrating.

Teachers had to come to school masked while students roamed freely maskless. Our COVID sick days were reduced to 5 per year. I took medical leave for 2 weeks and ended up losing over half my monthly paycheck because the rate to pay subs is higher than my daily rate.  Had a high school kid threaten to shoot up the school during my class. Kid is returned to my class weeks later. I had no explanation of what happened during that time. Same year had a 4 hour bomb threat lockdown where students were peeing in buckets and other containers bc we couldn’t go in the hall. Thanks to tik tok, Kids were vandalizing bathrooms so most bathrooms were locked up, causing students to need to miss class for 15 min just to find the nearest bathroom. Also thanks to tik tok, it was a trend to sexually assault your teacher by smacking them on the butt. A parent wanted to interview me for what I was teaching for the ENTIRE YEAR and I was required to attend that interview. We were asked to do janitorial duties because janitors were asked to work holidays for $11/hour and so they all quit. I teach ceramics and the room lacked safe ventilation. I didn’t have my own classroom, or an office for planning and it’s kind of necessary when your an art teacher to prep materials in the room you teach in. I have a masters with 8 years of certification and was being paid less than 55k per year in one of the most expensive cities in the USA. With health insurance and everything else deducted, I was barely taking home 3500 per month. What makes this worse is that teachers are bound to an annual contract that only benefits school districts (did you know they can just move you to another school at will if they choose? Or make you teach at two schools in one day so you have to travel for lunch?) They try to make it seem like breaking a contract will ruin your career and teachers do buy into this myth.  I left teaching that year to work remote in tech in an entry level job and already get paid more after 4 months of being here.

He has a bachelors degree in psychology, has coursework in ASL interpreting but didn’t complete the program and doesn’t want to be an interpreter, and is one of the kindest most caring individuals out there.

Update: I resigned today with someone from HR (principal was gone early today). I just got an email that I need to ""report to work and speak with the principal before any decision is made"" as if I'm not an adult and me saying I resign isn't final.

Another update: I forgot to mention one of the reasons I  want to leave is that the principal has three pending lawsuits for sexual assault. My father is an attorney and checked/accessed some of the sealed files when I first said I was working there. I was TERRIFIED because I was already seeing red flags. School threatened my license and my dad wrote a letter stating that as a young woman I was frightened and under emotional distress when I learned about the lawsuits.

Dont get me wrong, i love my kids and i dont feel anxious when im in front of the classroom teaching idk why. When i get home from work, i rest for abit and then do more work to prepare for work the next day. I hate this about the job, its like endless work. Maybe if i stick to teaching at the same school it will get better?

I also feel like im teaching kids to constantly conform to rules and not question them (how to sit or speak or behave or dress or write). Its like teaching a bunch of unique individuals to act or think the same way. Idk if im overthinking this, i jst feel like im shaping these kids to be part of the machine. The kids who question the system or the rules are considered “naughty” or “disrepsectful” and must be punished. If they dont write their essay in the structure that was taught, they wont do well. I feel like there are many bright kids that just give up bcos their way of thinking doesnt fit what’s considered good by the curriculum.

grabbed the handle and began yanking the door handle which in turn caused the door to push me over and over again. At this point the AP showed up and the student cussed me out. Is this assault? Idk what to do. I've been teaching for 8 years and I've never experienced this.",TeacherReality

I am currently looking for other jobs but so far I haven’t gotten anything. I live in the middle of nowhere so local employment is Walmart, the hospital, and the school.

I was let go that same year because I “wasn’t doing enough” according to admin. I was upset at their reasoning but felt relief as I didn’t love teaching anyway.

I decided to take the following year off of teaching and started to look for other jobs. I have a very specialist degree and two very specialist credentials. From September to May of last year I applied to hundreds of jobs for onboarding or HR and never even got an interview. I was an emotional wreck at this point and gave in and applied to one of the better private schools for the subject I teach. 

I got the offer and accepted it. I was so excited to be done job searching. As the start of the school year has gotten closer I’m DREADING the start of the school year. I hate teaching, I’m good at it and students like me but I absolutely hate it. On top of that the school pays so little I’ll be going negative about $1,000 a month.

Principal concluded that the lounge is a ‘toxic environment’ (because we vent and discuss admin’s managerial shortcomings as well as the school problems that come as a result) so he got rid of it, saying we can share one with the school on one of the upper floors (we’re in a basement and a small school that gets bullied by the others, so we feel shy about intruding on another school.) He didn’t make his reasoning public, but I overheard him tell a custodian, “they sit in there and talk shit, they can go talk shit upstairs, I don’t have time for that.” 
Talking shit being, ‘they promised we’d have computers for students in September, it’s now March and we still don’t have anything,’ and ‘Principal cornered and verbally abused me today, here is how to protect yourself.’ We know our admin work hard and do what they can with what we have, but that doesn’t make our school not a shit-show.

**On May 24, 19 students and two teachers were shot and killed at** [**Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas**](https://time.com/6181501/texas-school-shooting-victims-uvalde/)**—the   deadliest mass shooting in our state’s history. I remember staring at   my phone as the gut-wrenching headlines rolled in: fourth-grader** [**Miah Cerrillo**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/08/uvalde-congress-students-testify-gun-violence/) **had covered herself in her classmate’s blood to trick the shooter into thinking that she was already dead; teacher** [**Arnuflo Reyes**](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/us/uvalde-school-teacher-arnulfo-reyes-interview/index.html)**, who was shot in the arm and lung, lost 11 students in his class; and the body of 10-year-old** [**Maite Yuleana Rodriguez**](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/07/1103577387/matthew-mcconaughey-green-converse-shoes-sneakers-uvalde-maite-rodriguez) **was  so disfigured from the bullets that she could only be identified by   her lime-green Converse with a heart drawn on the right toe.  On the  news, the pictures of** [**grieving families**](https://time.com/6181718/uvalde-shooting-grieving-community/) **clinging  to one another, and of children climbing from windows and  sprinting  away from the school-turned-war zone with faces twisted in  shock and  confusion, were haunting. That same night, my friends and I  stayed up  late sharing articles and TikTok updates with the same  heaviness that  we’d felt after** [**Parkland**](https://time.com/6198426/parkland-shooting-sentencing-trial-day-one-recap/)**,** [**Santa Fe**](https://time.com/5282212/santa-fe-high-school-texas-school-shooting/)**, and** [**Oxford High**](https://time.com/6125256/michigan-school-shooting-covid/)**—now,   with the choking pain of another tragedy added to the list. It was the   dystopian familiarity of coming of age in the gun era.**

**When  I arrived at my Texas high school the next day, an administrator  was  standing at the door with a cart full of confiscated items. Of  course,  there were backpacks, which were never allowed during finals  week, but I  was surprised to see smaller bags, too—brown paper lunches,   end-of-the-year gifts for teachers—that my school had never taken up   before. Right before I could enter the building, the administrator   pointed at my laptop bag. “With what happened yesterday,” she explained   in an apologetic whisper, “we’re just on edge.”**

**I  handed over my bag without a second thought because I knew exactly how   my administrator was feeling. Like most American schools, we stop   breathing over Snapchat threats and warning messages posted to   Instagram. It’s only when the kid is caught with a gun in their pants   that we can breathe easy again, our grim relief that no one was hurt   outweighing the terror of what might have been. Because they could’ve   pulled the trigger, we face active-shooter drills that eat up entire   class periods and get trained to leave the door locked at all times, no   matter who’s begging to be let in—a peer, a principal, a best friend.   Sometimes, we even analyze hiding spots or plan for what to do if we’re   in the hallways, bathrooms, staircases, or cafeteria when the gunfire   starts, despite knowing, deep down, that nothing can really prepare us   for a moment like staring down the barrel of an assault rifle.**

**And with every school shooting—**[**27 so far, in 2022 alone**](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01)**—our fears gain legitimacy. It’s why lawmakers** [**are rallying around more armed on-campus officers**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/24/texas-republicans-uvalde-gun-control/) **and extra security checkpoints, and why Texas Republican** [**Senator Ted Cruz** ](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/sen-ted-cruz-proposes-one-door-entry-at-tx-schools-safety-experts-say-its-not-feasible)**pitched the idea of “having one door that goes in and out of the school.” Other prominent figures like** [**former President Donald Trump**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/27/donald-trump-nra-houston/) **and** [**National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre**](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/nra-wayne-lapierre-cpac-gun-rights-school-safety/2016151/) **seem to be reading from the same teleprompter flashing the same incessant buzzword: just** [**“harden” the schools**](https://time.com/6187656/school-safety-mass-shootings/)**.**

**But   while I understand that the knee-jerk reaction to violence is a push   for stronger security, I can’t help but ask questions. Why did I have to   give up my laptop bag? Why was my administrator screening for threats   like she was a TSA officer or a prison warden instead of a school   staffer? And why was my school—an educational institution—shouldering   the responsibility of checking for weapons to keep students and staff   from being gunned down?**

**Most  of all, I’m stunned that the concept of hardening schools is even a   casual talking point. To me, it feels like an admission—that gun   violence is the new normal, that school shootings will inevitably happen   again, and that there’s nothing we can do but to brace ourselves for   the next bang.**

**If  lawmakers don’t pass critical, common-sense gun laws like universal   background checks and 30-day waiting periods for gun sales that** [**are supported by the majority of Americans**](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx)**,   will students, already sandwiched between the social pressures of   fitting in and the pressure-cooker environment of academics, be forced   to brave even more active-shooter drills? Forced to resign ourselves to   the constant fear that our hallways might one day turn into a shooting   range? And on top of creating lesson plans and grading assignments,  will  teachers be expected to fend off an armed gunman,** [**a feat that even trained law enforcement officers couldn’t manage in Uvalde**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/20/uvalde-police-shooting-response-records/)**?**

**I don’t want to go through metal detectors and get my** [**clear backpack**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna862176) **searched  before taking a history test surrounded by steel doors and  bulletproof  windows. I don’t want my teachers, who are already  overworked and  underpaid, to lecture with a marker in one hand and a gun  in the other.  And I don’t want my school to be an impenetrable fortress  where I  learn how to instinctively run to the nearest exit instead of  how to  solve a math problem. It shouldn’t have to be that way for  students to  be safe at school.**

# Staffing shortage leads to involuntary teacher transfers at Montgomery County schools

 

**by John Gonzalez**

**Thursday, July 21st 2022** 

&#x200B;

 **MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. (7News) — Several public school teachers in Montgomery County say their summer break is coming to an abrupt end.** 

**Officials  with Montgomery County Public Schools have sent out a long list of  involuntary teacher transfers -- Some teachers received calls from  principals while on vacation. The union says the school system has  violated its contract.**

 **At Sherwood High School, close to two dozen staff members have been  relocated to other schools or told they will move into other positions,  with very little notice. Teachers report back to schools in about a  month.**

**7News  obtained a copy of the MCPS teacher contract, and it clearly states,  that principals will notify employees who have been involuntarily  transferred no later than Monday, February 28, 2022, and will provide  the (MCEA) education association a list of unit members identified for  involuntary transfer by the third Friday in March.**

**Also in the  contract it says, every effort will be made to notify the unit member of  the need for an involuntary transfer prior to the job fairs.**

 **In order to fill major staff shortages in other schools and cover  budget downfalls, some school electives and courses such as ESOL,  Women’s Studies and Business classes have been drastically reduced or  dropped.**

**Some 9th and 10th-grade classrooms already have 33 to 35 kids, more students than most classrooms have desks.**

**The  most recent school year ended with 581 unfilled positions countywide.  Meanwhile, 973 teachers have indicated they will be resigning or  retiring -- Which means class sizes are bound to increase.**

 **The teacher’s union says this situation violates the teacher contract --  several employees are being involuntarily transferred, receiving  surprise emails this week while on summer break. The union says they  should have been notified at least five months ago.** 

 **MCPS teacher resignations and retirements are up 38% in the past school year.**

**There are currently about 400 open teaching positions.**

**7News reached out to the school district and they sent us the following statement:**

***“School  systems across the country and throughout the region are faced with  challenges concerning open positions. One way to ensure that schools  have the employees needed is to transfer from a school with a surplus to  a school with a deficit, doing so ensures that students have the  teachers, administrators and support professionals needed. We are  working vigorously to recruit for all of our open positions, we do this  throughout the school year and are doing so now so that we begin school  fully staffed.”***

1658544603.0,Former teacher says he earns higher pay as Walmart professional,"  

**By: Maia Belay,** [**Nexstar Media Wire**](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/?post_type=profile&p=7076) 

**Posted: Jul 21, 2022 / 10:37 AM CDT** 

**Updated: Jul 21, 2022 / 11:10 AM CDT** 

 

**CANTON, Ohio (**[**WJW**](https://fox8.com/news/former-teacher-says-he-earns-higher-pay-as-walmart-professional/)**) — A former teacher said he is making more money as a Walmart professional.**

**Seth Goshorn taught for nearly six years, including at an elementary  school in Canton, Ohio, before deciding to change careers. It’s a  decision he said that led to an increase in pay by about $20,000 after  factoring in bonuses.**

**Dressed in his new Walmart uniform, Goshorn recorded a TikTok  video acknowledging the dramatic pay gap. He said the video  unexpectedly went viral.**

**“I didn’t think it would be this good. I might get a couple hundred  likes, so just the fact that it blew up and I’ve only been on it for  like a year,” Goshorn said. “It was really cool to see just the power of  the internet.”**

**Goshorn, who has a degree in early childhood education, is now  working as a “Walmart coach” on the management track. More than one  month into his new job, he said the transition was smooth.**

 

**“Last year I made about $43K teaching, so not anything terrible, but it also still left a lot to be desired,” said Goshorn.**



**He said he loved his time as a teacher and made lifelong friendships  with families. However, he was searching for a job that would better fit  his financial needs while planning an upcoming wedding with his  fiancée.** 

**Goshorn said working at Walmart provides professional growth without requiring a second degree.** 

**“My degree doesn’t exactly translate but the skills that a lot of  teachers have and the leadership ability teachers have does correlate to  a lot of companies,” he said. “So, find a company that’s willing to  train you for a position that might pay better.”**

**Goshorn does not discourage anyone from becoming a teacher and said  educators need additional support through increased salaries.**

&#x200B;

 **“Even though they’re scheduled for 40 hours, they’re working a lot  more than that, whether it’s teaching, grading after school,” Goshorn  said. “I coached football and track so those were other things on the  weekends. I did summer school. We don’t have all the time off that they  think.”**

**According to data referred to by the Ohio Department of Education,  the median teacher assignment salary statewide is $64,427. Salaries can  vary widely depending on which county and what school district a teacher  works in.** 

**Goshorn said he hopes his story serves as a teaching moment about the  power of the career pivot and the importance of supporting teachers.** 

**“I’m going to be a lifelong teacher,” he said. “That will always be a  part of my life, whether it’s at Walmart or on social media.”**

I taught for three years before becoming a full time technologist, and I'd heard some pretty wild stories back then. This app was inspired by one story in particular, where a female teacher friend of mine had to try to break up a fight during class between two male high school juniors. Not an ideal scenario. It would have been awesome to have a quick, discreet way to call for help.

In light of what happened in Uvalde and the lack of anybody doing anything about it, I'm releasing Little Red Button completely free and full featured (more features will be coming in the future). You can [download the iOS app here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/little-red-button/id1626397720) and you can [check out the website here](https://little-red-button.web.app/). A couple people have reached out about a more robust solution (eg for a special ed/SEAS school), so if that's something you're interested in, please reach out.

PS - Earlier this year I posted in a different sub about Little Red Button. At the time I was going to monetize it and it was going to be a Chrome extension. Neither of those are the case now.",TeacherReality

It's been said that one can find a lot of narcissism amongst higher academia, medicine, law and yes, school administration. All my admin had been good (mostly) until I was in my last job (which I quit).

 The principal was one of the those ""won't someone PLEASE think of the children!"" types who created a stifling, miserable environment by enacting draconian rules/guidelines that not only hurt staff but students too (e.g. requiring teachers to keep a violent child in their class and ""deal with it"" which not only was bad for the teacher, but created am unsafe space for the other kids). She also thought it was our responsibility to turn certain students who already hated school/teachers into school loving wonder kids. If we could not do that immediately, she'd torment us by questioning the ""culture"" of our classroom, w/o providing any examples or support/solutions.

I found this article problematic for a number of reasons.  The headline is misleading.  apparently Texas has been doing this for a long time.  no surprise here, I'm sure, but there are record numbers of teachers leaving their schools across the country.

We all know why.  It's different state to state. But it's really all the same.  In nc, gop legislator killed the teaching fellows program, a state program that covers higher education costs for people who teach.  They killed the pay increase for teachers when they get a masters.  And they adjusted the salary schedule to decrease pensions.  

Then nationally teachers are feeling the brunt of fairy tale propaganda around a ""liberal agenda"" and indictrination... district policies around covid they have no control of.  And then the difficulties in teaching during a pandemic when you're ""distance learning"" one week, face to face the next, and students and teachers both are in and out, quarantined for a week or two at a time.  

It's been rough.  

I have an msa.  Principals license in nc.  When I got the masters, I learned enough to know I'd never want the job of principal.  I just say that to vet my comment.

To be fired, teachers have to be given due process.  When they have tenure, they have a 4th(?) Amendment right to their job.  That's why it's hard to fire shitty teachers.  Side note: most important job of a principal is to make sure the adults in your school are good for kids.  Due process and documentation make it harder.  But that's the job.

I wonder if it could be argued that they have the same property right to their teaching license?  I know Texas legislators granted Texas state Ed dept authority to revoke licenses for leaving mid year.  But I sure as hell don't like that.  

The challenges teachers are facing right now are really hard.  But policies like this seem to place the blame of empty classrooms on teachers, penalizing them for giving up after having taken so much abuse that they just can't take it any more.

It's a job.  You can quit.  You shouldn't face prosecution for leaving a job.  Can you think of any other job where that hapens?

 Contract abandonment is a spin term.  Beginning teachers can be fired without due process when the district simply doesn't renew the contract.  So they get you coming and going.  

Sorry this is so long.  I'm sure nobody made it this far.  But wasn't it Arizona that brought in the national guard as warm bodies in classrooms? Texas is trying to stem the flow by MAKING them stay... at least til the end of the school year.  There is an exodus happening.  And I'm afraid that the  budgetary needs across the nation to fix the problems will be prohibitive.

2. This country values $$ over education & thus using education as a vehicle to collect money from others is a primary goal (High cost of education)

1647692205.0,My contract wasn't renewed and I'm so devastated,"This happened on Wednesday and I am taking it so hard. I have worked at this school in 7th grade for 6 years now, 3 1/2 as a para and 2 1/2 as a special education teacher. I got my certification while working. My job is insanely hard but I work really hard and I make great connections with my students. There was never any indication given to me that I wasn't doing a good job. I never had a review (until Tuesday, after they already knew that I was being fired), there was never a conversation, I was given no chances to improve. My coworkers all support me and think that I do a good job. I know I'm still green but I really felt like I was hitting my stride this year and starting to get the hang of it. I even sent an email to my boss saying that, though she already knew I was being let go. 

On Wednesday I was called into a room (with a union rep thankfully) and told that my contract is not being renewed for next year, but they would hire me back on as a para. This is insulting because it is about a 40% paycut, there's no way I can live on that. No reason is given, and since it's been less than 5 years, I don't think they have to give me one. 

I don't bring this up to garner sympathy, but it's important for context. I found out in December that my mom had terminal cancer and that she would be starting chemo. I am super close to my mom and she lives near me, this was absolutely devastating news. I shared this with my principal because I (naively) trusted her. She acted sympathetic at the time. I have major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. All of that was in check until my mom got sick, then I really fell off the deep end. 

At the encouragement of my principal and others (I do recognize that ultimately it was my decision) I took 3 weeks of FMLA so I could pull myself together. I saw a psychiatrist, changed my meds, started making lifestyle changes, and when I returned to work I legitimately felt so much better, and I really started feeling much better about my work. 

As I said, I am too trusting and my principal is privy to a lot of my mental health struggles but I won't get into all of that. It is important to note though, that she knows things about me that others don't which is why I think it was the impetus for my firing. I think they think I'm a wreck and not worth the hassle, and don't want to be around for the fallout when my mom passes. 

No one owes me any favors because my mom is sick, but it seems so heartless and cruel, and personal. I was never put on an improvement plan and never once told that I wasn't doing something right. My school is very supportive and I reach out for help when I need it and I am constantly eager for feedback on how to improve. I'm friends with everyone in the school, I'm friendly and well liked, and now I have to say goodbye to all these people I have worked with for 6 years. 

I also have to finish out the year, so I am reminded constantly of the pain and betrayal. I have to play it straight too because I can't get ""fired"" fired. I am hurting so bad, I feel like I'll always question other's kindness now, as I feel that is ultimately what cost me my job. Special ed is in high demand and I'm a HQT for middle school ELA, so I think I'll find a job, but it doesn't make this feel any better. Sorry this was so long, it weighs on my mind a lot. 

TL;DR I got fired from my teaching job with no explanation and no opportunity to improve, probably relating to my mental health issues. I am sad about it.",TeacherReality

Yesterday, I got a pretty terrific curriculum development offer. I wanted to share what worked for me, in case it’s helpful for any other soon-to-be-former teachers. 

-When it became clear that I needed to leave teaching, I started monitoring job boards for edtech and curriculum roles. 

-However, what I found more helpful was going to the individual websites for the different curriculum companies, professional development orgs etc that I’ve come to know over the years. I made a spreadsheet with the direct links to the relevant career page for each organization, so it would be easier to keep tabs on all of them quickly. 

-Here’s where luck somewhat took over. (I’m still trying to give myself credit. [ya know, imposter syndrome] but really, this was a lot of luck.)There was a posting for *three* openings in one of my specialty areas at a curriculum organization that I’ve know for years and have grown to deeply admire. 

-I applied, and then reached out to someone I sort of knew at the organization. This person was a lead curriculum designer for another content area, but I had a feeling he might be connected to this project too. I sent him an email saying basically, “You might remember me from xyz school, now I am very I interested in joining the abc team.” And he wrote back saying that he is actually the lead for the abc team had been pleased to see my application— score!

-From there, they had me do a take home assignment and a panel interview. And yesterday, they offered me the job!

-The downside is that it’s about a $10k paycut. I live in a very HCOL area, so my teacher salary was higher than average. However, the job is remote and the hours seem very reasonable. For me, the trade off is worth it.

This is my first and only school I’ve taught at for my entire career. We have a reputation for taking students who have been removed from other schools. I’ve had the INCREDIBLE opportunity to watch my kids grow and I’m excited to see who they will become.

However. 

It has now gotten to a point where there are so many escalations and disregulated students harming others (bullying, fighting, online harassment, and just straight up not letting anyone teach by yelling out and screaming at teachers) and I have no recourse aside from calling parents. Admin seem to be in survival mode and just want to keep people from physically hurting others until the end of the year. That’s it. I know they’re overwhelmed as well. But I’m tired of working three jobs and selling my plasma just to get by, only to be told by a ten year old that “I’m really starting to piss him off” just for having the audacity to ask him to stop talking during my class. Every day is constant arguing and struggle. I teach a specials class for gods sake (art, music, gym). We have fun! But the kids have been through so much in the past few years with quarantine and rough home lives; Everything has compounded and it just feels like the people above me have given up on them.

In the event that is not the case here are two resources that I hope can help some of you out there. 
Many schools and unions provide an EAP (Employee Assistance Program) as part of their benefits.  An EAP is to help provide resources for employees in a variety of areas. It can be used by everyone in your household. They provide references for mental health professionals in your area and depending on your program the EAP pays for several appointments. (The programs I have used paid for between 3 and 6 appointments.) They also provide referrals for child care, legal advice, financial advice, life coaching, etc. It is also completely confidential; they legally cannot inform your employer you have even contacted them. You can call them several times. For example, if you called about a conflict with an administrator, you can get your free sessions. You can call again about an issue with a parent and get another set of sessions. Had a fight with your husband? Call and get another set of sessions. I have not found a limit to this yet. Remember, anyone in your household can use it as well. If your spouse is struggling, they can get free sessions. If you have a child that is struggling, they can get free sessions. 
The other resource that I have found very helpful is NAMI, National Alliance on Mental Illness. I just started to be familiar with this organization. Their website has a lot of really good information. In some areas, they have support groups for people with mental illness and for their families. They have a help line 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) that is available M-F 10AM-10PM. What I found most helpful is their text line, my breakdowns tend to be in the evenings or Sundays. They have trained crisis counselors that are available for free 24/7. All you have to do is text NAMI to 741741. It has been the extra support that I needed to be able to get to the next day. 
I hope no one needs it but I feel this is a case that there is not harm in repeating it and providing it to people who might already know it. If you would like to message me about any of this information feel free to message me.",TeacherReality
1645491280.0,Do the poor working conditions filter for a personality type?,"First of all, let me first say what a relief it is to find this sub. The working conditions in teaching are NOT normal or acceptable, and it's nice to find others who can say it openly.

Second of all, I'm going to be very direct and frank in the commentary I want to make. I'm sorry if I word things awkwardly, and if there's a better way to express something, I'd appreciate some correction from others here.

Third of all, I want to speak from my own experience teaching in higher education. I have not been a k-12 teacher, though my wife is in a private school. I've been a university lecturer and college adjunct professor in a few different contexts. 

The working conditions in US higher ed are laughably bad. I used to see comically over-the-top labor abuses within the University of California, and someone described to me (accurately, I think) working as a college adjunct as being ""basically an uber driver."" I got frustrated after 3 years of the nonsense, and took an entry-level job at a luxury hotel doing manual labor. I actually made more money there even though it was a minimum wage job I could've gotten in high school, but I digress.

BY FAR the most frustrating aspect of teaching in higher education was **the other people I worked with**. I would see (again) COMICALLY over-the-top labor abuses and bureaucratic dysfunction in, for example, the University of California, but the other people in my same precarious position would bend over backwards into their own assholes to defend the schools and programs, at times as if they were defending their own families. I knew for a fact that these other lecturers had no financial incentive, had no promise of more stable working conditions, and could sometimes be under even worse conditions than I was. And yet, they pushed back against any and all criticisms of the schools/curriculum, even outside of the school in our personal lives. 

When I took entry-level jobs in the private sector, I would see similar abuses and mismanagement. The major difference was that *the other people I was working with* would openly articulate, talk about, and acknowledge that wrong things were going on. They normally would NOT bend over to defend inappropriate management, or the money guzzlers at the top. It is honestly a breath of fresh air to speak to others who can state plainly what is right in front of our faces. 

I have no sympathy for the people who are in those shitty working conditions at the universities I worked in. These were the same people who would fight tooth and nail to the death to convince me that the schools NEEDED to treat us like garbage, and that's the way it has always been, and I need to change my attitude. 

But...where in the world does this obsequies sycophancy come from? I have this working theory that I'm hoping others can help me with. 

One of the jobs that I took after getting fed up with higher ed was as an enumerator with the 2020 US Census. My gig with the census may have the biggest shitshow I have ever been a part of, and it was truly an appropriate crescendo for the Trump administration to purposefully make it into a shitshow, as the president's 1 term in office was coming to an end. 

However, the best part of the job BY FAR was going on the r/Census subreddit and shit-talking the whole thing with other like-minded people. Others had even worse experiences in the Census than I had had, with stories about inappropriate supervisors, dangerous situations that the bureau refused to rectify, and (to top it all off) the failure of the federal department to issue W-2 forms once the thing was all over. 

Somewhere along the line, towards the end of Census operations in October, something changed on the subreddit. MASSIVE amounts of people quit their census jobs, and I can only guess that not long after they quit, they stopped participating in the census subreddit. That meant that by the end of operations, rational people had already been long filtered out, and only the goobers were left. I remember that I posted a thread about a negative personal experience I had while out in the field, and I would receive replies along the lines of, ""Well, that sounds like a you problem!"", or ""You need to act more professional as a Census enumerator!"" My posts earlier into census operations WOULD NOT have gotten such responses. 

Given that I love teaching, I'm really good at it (I've gotten nothing but top evaluations in university/college settings), and I feel like I work well with middle-school aged students, I've thought about pursuing a position as a middle school teacher in a public school. Of course, here in California I would need to pay $15k for the credential that would allow me to even apply to jobs, I hesitated, but what really turns me off is the thought of the absolute wieners I may need to work with. When it comes to teachers, I've seen many things: people with personality disorders, hormonal imbalances, abusers, or mood disorders who take out their mental illness on powerless teenage students, tenured teachers who teach their class by simply having students stare at a wall for 2 hours (I've mostly seen this one in math classes for some reason), and of course the English Language Arts idealists who wish they were Robin Williams's character in *The Dead Poet Society*. The idealists concern me the most, as I see them as working with fewer professional boundaries. 

Shit conditions create a toxic workplace, in which talented and caring teachers are filtered out and only the losers are left. 

I want to leave, but then I think...my own kids are going to need to be taught in these failing systems someday. They will need to suck up to the abusive teachers with mood disorders or hormonal imbalances, and their future will depend upon their ability to get subjectively awarded letter grades from people who are lucky to have found a position paying them $40k per year. 

Am I on to something here? US schools seem to be a work environment that demands conformity to loser behaviors...right?",TeacherReality

So yeah people not in the classroom and haven’t been in years doing cheers and lecturing us that we are the ones who determine the success and failure of the class. Really?!?

Last year I had a parent tell me they couldn’t have anyone over because the kid didn’t like it. I signed up to teach reading, writing, math, science.

1645133445.0,Question for Everyone (Especially Teachers) 🤔,"Hello Reddit world! This is my first ever post on any page of reddit, so I apologize in advance if I mess up the etiquette of posting, but please bear with me.

I have been worried lately about the troubling signs of the death of our public school system. Whether it's the conservative bills aimed at teachers curriculums, or the hateful rhetoric being thrown at teachers and their unions, I can't help but feel like America is on its way to privatizing the school system entirely, which terrifies me. I fear for the families that rely on public education for their children's schooling, and that would most likely be unable to afford a private education for their children. I'm also worried, that some of the loudest voices against teachers and public schools are also some of the people who would be impacted the most by the end of public schooling in America.

So, I wanted to ask the people and teachers here some questions. I will put them in a list below:
1.) Are you worried about the death of public schools in America?
2.) If public school ends, what do you think the new system will look like?
3.) Do you believe education will still be a requirement for families, one that is punishable by law if they choose not to have their children go to school/can't afford it?
4.) Do you believe education is a right? Or is it a privilege?
5.) How do you feel the end of public schools will affect the country (if it happens)?

Reddit admin has reinstated me as a moderator (I was the third moderator down before being removed by the previous top mod) as well as the other mods. Given the mess you see before you, you are probably wondering whether I am fit for this job (I know I am wondering the same thing). 

I want to assure you we are going to work to make this community better. We want a community that is inclusive of everyone who enters into it with good intentions. This was meant to be a sub that offered the public an understanding of the daily experience of teachers and guidance to teachers who, unfortunately, felt they could not continue in the profession. It was meant as a place to improve education, not disparage it or the professionals that put in the hard work every day to improve the lives of their students.

Teaching can be hard. I have been an educator for 16 years. I have attended my students' funerals. I have made the calls to CPS. I have been helpless to stop things I knew were wrong. That does not change my unwavering faith that the work we do is just and right. 

I want this work to be more sustainable. I'm tired of watching young teachers burn out. That is why we are here-- to offer care and support.

I have to finish my work day now (snow days aren't snow days anymore), but I hope you'll hang on as we restructure and bring this sub back to life. 

P.S. Mods should serve at the discretion of the community for benefit of the community. The hardest part of all of this for me was watching as someone who did not have the community's interest at heart acting like a petty tyrant. If you have concerns about the current moderation, please state them here. If it is necessary for me to step down, I will work to ensure first that competent, caring hands have control of moderation within the sub.",TeacherReality

If you are thinking of changing careers, but think you aren't qualified..... 

Teachers are belittled and taken advantage of to ensure we are kept in our place. We are constantly micromanaged so that we don’t think we are capable of other work or functioning and having success on our own in another workplace. This micromanagement/belittling is done to keep highly qualified teachers in the place where society needs us to be in order to take advantage of us. We are capable and qualified for many other things. Not to mention higher salaries. 

If you feel like you are unqualified for a job that you want, apply anyway. Most jobs in EdTech or tech startups are figuring it out as they go along. If you don’t understand the tech lingo, you are capable of adapting to the systems and the skills that you would need are learnable skills. 

Think of how much you had to learn on the job in a short amount of time in your first year of teaching. You are adaptable; sell that in your cover letter. You adapted to the pivot from in-person to online learning and you probably did it overnight; that makes you tech savvy. Be confident in yourself because you are worth more than you realize.

My class average is like a 33 and the only reason I let them slack off is because I cannot help that they were conditioned to not do any work, but the principal still expects that they pass for graduation rates to look good. 

So they will pass without deserving it.

Talk about sex, drugs, and drinking in front of me. Openly cuss with no regard to their environment.

I am shocked to say the least at what high school has become. I guess you really have to pick which hill you’ll die on but the standards have fallen so low for student conduct.

Those who evaluated me last year seemed very caring and like they were genuinely interested in making sure I improved. This year it’s much different, as a non-tenured teacher I feel my job is always at risk. I do not want to feel like this for another two year.

My lesson was not perfect but I felt that it was harsh given the sample size and context of the lesson. I feel that both observations I’ve had this year the take away is, “I would have done this, so that’s what you should have done.” I never want to lose my individuality as a teacher. 

It seems to add what they want in every single one of my lessons getting through the curriculum is out of reach and would take hours more planning. Some nights as is I plan and make materials till 10 or 11 pm. I don’t know how much more I can mentally give.

I stand up and I see him sitting there, his face all read as he's telling F that he's tired of his shit.  He keeps repeating, ""I'm tired of your shit!"" He slams his iPad down on the desk and stands up. The whole time I'm trying to get them to stop yelling at each other, but they have no interest in me in the slightest. F stands up as well, posturing to fight. They're at the verbal threats phase when I make it to the phone and dial for assistance. 

I'm still working hard to de-escalate the situation and try to keep these kids from killing each other but they're completely deaf to anything I have to say. Our psychologist (whose room is across from mine) comes over, and so does my neighbor teacher - she left her class because she heard the commotion. Someone flips the lights on, the psychologist calls on her radio for assistance as well. They're trying to help de-escalate.

I teach the ELL, intervention, and iep kids. She was so rude to me and then the advanced English teacher jumped in and literally said this comment to me ""that's what teaching is, we break things down so that the kids can understand it"". All I was trying to explain to them was that I had started the unit plan last week from day 1 and decided today that I was going to go back and re teach claim, evidence, and reasoning. It really was the most unprofesisonal thing I have experienced.

I found out from my co teacher that one of the 8th grade teachers leaves PLC in tears whenever the gifted teacher attends their meetings. This is not an isolated incident. 

I felt so undermined in that moment as a professional. I was shaking when I went to my meeting with my instructional coach because I was about to cry. I explained to my coach what happened and we sat down to go over the proficiency scale. She told me I was right on target and to focus on students building a strong argumentative paragraph instead of a five paragraph essay.

This was a scary situation and I felt very alone. I would like to give some clarification of this incident as well as an update. Warning, it's still in progress but so far it hasn't been great. For context, I work with high schoolers in a rural town.

The situation was this: I was observing the lunchroom when he made a comment about someone's ass. I turned around and he said ""Why'd you turn around?"" In the moment I was very confused and it seemed like he had been speaking about me. As I stated, I informed my supervisor and principal. The next day the student found me while I was doing bus duty and he started yelling at me. When I informed the Principal, she later asked me if I would be willing to sit down and discuss it with him to ""take my power back"". We just had the meeting today...two weeks later.

The student alleged that they had been ""talking about their friend behind me"", and I just happened to turn around. I told him how bad it looked, and how he had no right talking to *anyone* that way. And that the reason why I had approached the principal about the situation was that if anyone looked at the incident from an outside perspective (adult and minor flirting), I could lose my job. I had to protect myself. I reiterated that his aggressive approach to me after the incident did not help his case either. He apologized for his behavior and for ""any unnecessary trauma he may have caused."" Whether he meant it or not is still up for debate...

I am currently in the process of trying to set up a meeting with HR to discuss how this was handled. How it felt like this was taken lightly, and not as serious as it could be. How I did not feel safe the, again, *two weeks* it took to set this meeting up. I asked for a male coworker to stand with me during bus duty just to feel slightly safer at my own job.

I also have informed my Union Rep, though technically I'm still in the process of having my application accepted. She is on my side and has been supporting me through all of this.

I'm sorry this isn't the big, badass update you all may have been wanting. But I'm still trying to find my footing in this. I promise I won't stop and let this slide.

What's stopping you from quitting and moving to something more valued by society?,"EDIT: After reading through these posts I think a common thread I'm seeing is that a lot of people just feel like it's their calling. I was talking to my wife about this exact topic last night and she said that a lot of teachers feel that way and that I wouldn't understand because I never have felt that way about a job and looking at these replies and thinking about it more I think she's right. 


I don't know if there's a way to word this without it coming off as maybe a little offensive but I am curious the thoughts of teachers on it.

I've been following the events of the last several years in regards to education. It seems like half the country just has a pretty anti-education stance at this point. They're banning books, parents are threatening teachers and administrators at board meetings, the kids seem to be out of control and not to give a shit largely... Cities don't properly fund schools so that teachers are expected to teach more and more kids each class to the point where it just seems impossible to do a good job. Schools are putting kids in debt for food... Also if you think of the salary that teachers get as a metric of how valued they are by society it's not good and honestly it's never been good. A huge and disproportionally powerful chunk of society just seems to be making it their personal mission to make the profession shittier.

My question is, why don't you just throw your hands up and go fuck it, fuck these kids and their stupid parents. The parents want to tell me how to teach, you teach your dumb kids then and they're going to grow up to be dumb fucks just like you, not my problem anymore. Do you feel trapped in the profession because it's what you went to school for? You're all smart people wouldn't a company want to hire you for something? Why not just quit and wash your hands of it all and just stop thinking about it. The country doesn't value education anymore and that seems to be getting worse so why not just give up on it?

I'm not a student or a parent and I never will be a parent so maybe that's why I have this attitude? I vote on increasing the budget and funding for schools whenever possible but I feel like people just don't value it, they don't want to pay for it. A lot of people say they support teachers but when it comes down to it I don't think they actually do, it's just lip service.",TeacherReality

I don't think many people will see this, but anybody who does... I appriciate you.

I have been looking at some of my school's ""unofficial"" student community pages on Instagram. A few students I know are being badly bullied through some very inappropriate pages. 

By accident, I ran across a short video from a student captioned ""sneaking into a freshmen class to mess with the sub!""... And I recognized it as being from a class that gave me pure hell a few months ago. I turned the sound on and recognized my voice in the background. I am a deeply unpopular individual with the student body. I enforce the mask mandate and tell people they cannot hang out in the bathrooms. It has crossed my mind that I probably cross a few Snapchat stories, but now I am worried about the kids likely photographing or taking video of me for pranks.

It's not all my students, obviously. None of my AP, honors, or even level 2 kids would dream of this. I hear from other teachers, counselors,  and admin how many of my students love me and my classes. I try to hold onto that. 

But I have 3 level 1 art classes, mostly 9th graders, and many of them who never wanted an art class. There are 55 students in each of these classes. (Yes, FIFTY-FIVE.) I work very hard to get them excited, to show them that anyone can learn to make art even if they've never been ""talented"" at it. But I can't give much individual attention with 55 in the room. 

I spend a lot of time telling students to sit down and put their phones away. But many of them act like I'm ""trippin'"" when I ask them to follow basic school rules--the same rules that the principal reiterates over the intercom every morning.

While my students are doing well from a data/grades standpoint, I will be the first to admit that I'm in ""survival mode"" and am not differentiating instruction a ton as far as doing a lot of different or new activities. I'm sort of sticking to the basics and getting through a week or even day at a time.

Lord knows I could use some support, but I'm fluent in administrative/managerial speak, so I'm pretty sure I know where this is headed. 

Had my meeting today, and got my ""support"": a more detailed lesson plan template to be used and submitted more frequently, an update to my professional development plan that will involve admin choosing my goals for the rest of the semester, and a TBD number of meetings with our district's instructional coach. This is all to change the fact that I'm not utilizing my instructional time appropriately, and that students aren't learning or being properly prepared for assessments. 

What I did not get was a chance explain or defend myself. Well, to be fair, at the end of the 20 minute meeting I was asked if I have any questions, and I could have used that time to do so. But, like...would there have been a point? We (school/district/state/country) are basically pretending COVID is over. Safety protocols are a joke. No one above the teacher level is acknowledging that we're essentially back to hybrid learning, since we all have at least a few students per class who are out sick or quarantining. Expectations and demands on us are not only not staying the same, they're *increasing.* And for what? We got a couple percent raise in this year's state budget, so there's that.

1642700113.0,"Teachers punching kids, my controversial (?) take.","If you're not aware of it, there was a video posted a little while ago where a kid is being terrible, the teacher reaches a breaking point, and the teacher swings.

*Tldr at bottom*

Down near the bottom of that thread, you'll find my comments. Which I acknowledge were poorly phrased, and you'll see they got a lot of downvotes. I want to take a second to express myself better, and hopefully have a discussion, if people still disagree with me and want to downvote that's cool I'll eat it.

When we see a teacher taking a swing at a kid, and all we do is condemn the teacher or applaud the teacher, we're missing the chance for a good conversation. It should go without saying that it is almost never appropriate for an adult to hit a kid.

Just in case it's not clear, the teacher should not have hit the kid.

With that said, I don't think we can just condemn the teacher and walk away. We have to condemn the systemic failings that put the teacher in that situation in the first place. Because it's easy to judge from the other side of a keyboard. But every single person has a breaking point.

I am not a teacher right now, specifically because I knew it was not good for me to be somewhere where I was going to have to dance on that line.


**Back to the controversial thought.**

In America we have primary positions where we expect people to deal with the public as an authority. Teachers, and cops. I'm going to leave out my political opinions on cops, because I don't think it's worthwhile in this discussion, but I will simply say that de-escalation should play a much higher role, and violence a much smaller role, in policing.

Regardless, cops have a pretty big tool belt when it comes to carrying out their objectives, maintaining their authority, and trying to feel safe. Regardless of abuse, that's not the topic, there are a lot of tools.

What tools do teachers get? Ask nicely? Call the office and hope they come down?

And as a cop, you're not in a high stress situation from the moment you clock into the moment you clock out. Even on the worst beat, you've got a partner, you can go back and hang out in your car for a little bit, back up is always waiting to come. It's not you on the streets by yourself for 8 hours straight with pretty much no help.

You remind me of the horrors I used to hear in the teacher's lounge. Teachers saying horrible things about their students in their back. What the fuck was wrong with them? And with some of you?

Now I understand it probably was not a coincidence that I was the **only** teacher in the whole school that had a great relationship with the students, with my classes always being kind-of-quiet, never losing my composure... and that I was the only one who seemed to respect the students as actual people.

But what happened to you all that you think it's okay to **sucker-punch a kid in the face** ? What's the fucking excuse? Because a literal KID was MEAN to you? Go to fucking therapy instead!

1642655762.0,First Year Teacher and I Already Believe I'm a Terrible Instructor and Ready to Leave,"Hey everyone,

I apologize for the long rant I am about to make. I just feel so lost and need some advice on job opportunities. Please skip to the end if need be. I just need to get my thoughts out somewhere.

As the title states, I am a new teacher who is teaching English, and I never had the opportunity to student teach before the pandemic hit. Got a job across the state after finishing my master's in theater (English BA), and I was so excited to be pursuing my desired career and not living off unemployment looking for anything to survive. The salary is the best I have made in my life so far (late 20s for reference), which is sad, yet I thought it was the start to a wonderful stage in my life to begin helping out kids and doing my best to be an effective instructor...that is up until now. 

I.feel.awful. I am a terrible teacher. No one prepared me for what things would be like. I had an understanding that the first year or two may be rough, yet not like this. I know I am going to make many mistakes, yet didn't expect to receive such backlash from students and parents, and I feel so worthless. While my admin and fellow teachers are supportive and say this will pass and to just survive, I feel like I have been thrown to the wolves. No resources or guidance given to me on what to teach, and every unit and lesson plan I make is on the fly. Every day I am just wondering how a lesson or unit will go that I can create on my off time, since my planning periods are busy covering for teachers out from covid. Some days are great, and many other days the lessons don't work. That's fine, it's part of the growing pains right? That's what I want to believe...I want to believe I am doing the best I can with the hand I have been dealt, yet still feel like a joke of a teacher.

The kids overall are just disrespectful and nasty to me. I feel like I am failing them, yet I am trying so hard and learning as well. Even with how they treat me, I care about their education and want them all to be successful. Some are wonderful and enjoy the theatrical display I put on as I pretend I am not screaming internally and teach them what I can, yet it is exhausting. My mental health has plummeted. I dread going to work or having to talk with my students.

 I let teenagers get to me as they give me lip and don't pay attention or refuse to do work...and these are honors students. They view any new teacher as inferior and not worth their time. Even when they haven't been taught a good amount over the last few years, like writing a properly formatted essay...they just don't follow and refuse to believe I know what I am talking about...and when I don't give them As because they did it wrong or was written poorly? Parents come lashing out because I am a problem teacher. Their child never fails, so it's my fault they are. How dare I not give them an A like others do. The ones who don't even turn it in? Admin says give them a 50 at best. Don't give Fs otherwise. Never a 0.

I try my best to be patient with them and not lose my cool, because it's not professional or right to raise my voice in a mean way or return the nasty behavior. On the days where I can get students to follow along and learn, I feel a little better about myself...until the moment I make one tiny mistake, and I am jumped on. As for admin helping me with behavior? A slap on the wrist for that kid being rude and they are fine as they don't want to ""upset the parents"". 

I feel helpless. Does it get better? Did I pick the worst time to jump in as a new teacher during a pandemic? Or is this the reality and future of education in the US? Am I just bad at this job? I am just so unhappy and tearing myself apart mentally and it's affecting my life outside and my personal relationships. 

To all of the teachers who have had more years of experience and go through this; I absolutely respect you. I feel weak and mentally soft for feeling this way after only five months. I don't know how many of you are still doing this. The only reason why I feel motivated to even go to work is because I feel like I have no other way to get a job with a reasonable income. 

Should I just quit? I don't even know what jobs a new English teacher with minimal experience in education could do. I have mostly been a student before this. I just feel so lost and defeated and I feel terrible writing this. For those who have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my rant. I am already considering finding a therapist to help me out with my depressed state. I just need to know what routes to even consider. 



TL;DR: New English teacher with no prior experience, not even student teaching. I feel like a terrible teacher and the job and treatment from students and parents has left me in a dangerously depressive state.

1643106953.0,How to escape from Teaching to Tech: an easy guide,"##Why?

- High employment
- Huge salaries
- Really not so hard
- Often can work remote
- Your boss HAVE TO make you happy because you can just quit

##Which industry?

- Video games, software development, webdev...
- Webdev currently a very good choice, lots of demand, good work condition, high salaries. I only know webdev, so I will talk here about webdev.

##Is it easy?

Nothing worth doing is really easy. It is a LOT of work, because there are a **lot** of things to learn. It can be a very pleasant experience depending on your situation and interests, or it can be not for you at all.

This article will try to list everything that can help you or impede you. If you have a lot of positive points, you should definitely do it. If you don't, then maybe not.

##Which skills are needed?

- Passion for programming: huge advantage, but not mandatory.
- Ability to sit in front of a screen for long times (or stand, you WILL invest in a standing desk eventually)
- Talent: Some people learn faster than others. Some people start with an affinity for computer logic. You don't need talent to succeed, but talent will help you achieve your goals faster.

##Can anyone do it?

- Some people can't learn programming at a decent pace.
- Most people can succeed in a couple years.
- Some people can succeed in a very short time (6 months to a year)

Teachers are often bright people, so most of you should be in 2nd or even 3rd category.

ADHD/Autistic people usually succeed very well from what I've seen (conditions apply).

Note: these estimations are assuming you are in the ""unemployed"" category. If you work full-time on the side, it can be much longer.

##Personal advantages:

- You have a network of programmers around you (friends, family)
- Non-native English speakers: you speak English fluently

##Personal disadvantages:

- You have kids. It's already a lot of work, a lot of pressure, and a lot of interruptions while you study. Still possible, but it makes it harder.

##How to learn?

- Self-taught works: online MOOCs and courses.
- Paid bootcamps: Sometimes bad. Sometimes very expensive. Sometimes great. Need to check what they're teaching, ""real"" reviews from alumni, etc.
- 42 free coding school: In Paris and Silicon valley (maybe other places). I recommend it if you can get past the entrance exam. Don't need to finish the full 3-years, you can leave after one.

Other considerations: You need to work on Unix for most technologies, so either install Linux, or if you have too much money and you don't hate apple then buy a mac.

Additionally, you should balance your time between practicing and learning. Practicing should go first, until you're blocked, then it's time to learn. Once you know enough to unblock you, go back to practicing.

##What to learn?

Full guides here: [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/)
Frontend is a good choice for starters and a good entry to the job. You can also aim to enter as backend or fullstack, but you need some frontend knowledge anyway.

The guides are a good resource, but you should also check where you live/where you WANT to live and see what's the most sought after there.

##When to learn?

- While working on the side (so on evenings, weekends): Difficult, but might be doable. Might take a much longer time.
- Quitting your job to study: Much easier, but you need to be able to support yourself financially.

##Timeline for self-taught webdev

To learn a new technology, you usually start with lessons and short exercises (i.e on [websites like this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)). Then I would advise to build a decent-size project to really be sure you're past tutorial hell (see below). This project should take at least a couple week of full-time work.

Then keep learning highly researched new technologies. When you know ""enough"", start looking for a job. ""Enough"" might be HTML/CSS/Javascript + React + other stuff like Git (see guides).

While you're actively looking for a job, keep working on personal projects.

Finally, know that ""writing working code"" is not enough, you need to produce Enterprise-grade code. Read about ""Best practices"". Try to find a mentor to guide you on this vast topic.

##What are the biggest challenges?

- Tutorial hell: when you are able to do ""coding exercises"", very small projects, small web pages, but are unable to start a real project which scales in complexity. No easy solution for this except practice, practice, practice.

- First job: The first job is the hardest to get. The reason is that rookie developers actually cost more to a company than they bring, and once they start working efficiently they often leave for a better job. So companies have little incentive to hire you out fresh out of school.

Once you are past 2 years experience as a developer, [you are worth more than money](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/companies-worry-more-about-access-to-software-developers-than-capital.html) and will never be hungry again.

1697257011.0,My age is impacting my authority?,"Hello! I’m a 20yr old female dance teacher who is having trouble garnering respect from my students, fellow dancers, and some fellow teachers. For some context my fellow dancers are around high school age and my students range from 3-10yrs old. I also happen to default to saying “yes” when it comes to helping others in my free time, I am diagnosed with autism (the faculty are aware) and I have taught in a public school and in a ballet company. 

I believe that my age is impacting my authority because a parent of a student who was acting out in class said that I looked like a, “big sister” instead of a teacher. I have also been talked down to by the high school dancers because I am supposedly too old to be allowed to sit somewhere even if I got there first or I have seniority in the company. However, these same dancers would make way for other dancers my age with the same skills if they happen to guest for our company. I was also kinda forced to massage one of the senior eachers because I was not busy. They did not stop to ask if I was ok with it. 

I have been in therapy and am now learning that people can take advantage of you, but I want to develop authority at least equal to my position in the school. I have been working on declining things that I am not interested in doing, but I still have trouble with saying “no” in the moment. Is there any way to change my reputation at my school?

1695876265.0,Tonight I was scolded by a parent for telling their kid to quiet down.,"I am a high school music teacher who often takes students to events after school. Tonight we were on a bus and the students were very exuberant,  talking and laughing loudly.  One girl in particular had a very high pitched -ear piercing laugh which was bothering our bus driver who asked her to stop. The kids ignored the bus driver, so I stepped in calling the girl’s name and asked her to quiet down. (Loudly in order to be heard over the commotion)

As parents often come to these events, the parent s of the loud girl approached me very upset that I had yelled at their child in front of a bus full of students which embarrassed her. They also felt the need to explain to me that their daughter has a loud voice and I should understand that she can’t control it. 

So, I’m not supposed to control a situation where a child’s high pitched laugh is distracting a bus  driver in fear that I might embarrass the kid? How does this make sense?

I work for a Montessori school for preschoolers as an assistant and have been there for almost a year. We have a very high turnover rate for assistants cause we were always understaffed and people leave constantly. I’ve given my 2 week notice and was asked to stay one more week as we have some staff that are out for vacation. I ended up agreeing cause I felt bad and wanted to show how dedicated I am even if I’m leaving. Side note, I personally feel like the parents trust me more than the newer assistants since I’ve been there longer than then. So some parents I feel like are comfortable talking to me about their child’s day or progress. The other day I was called by my assistant director and director to the office, saying that a parent “complained” that I made their child seem like they are terrible or bad… and a couple days before I was talking to that same parent informing her that I’ll be leaving and of course she was saying that it’s sad for them to see me go. I also was telling her that I will miss working with her kid since her kid is in preschool and I was assigned for toddlers that week I am originally for preschool and hated that they’ve put me in toddlers since I’ve never worked with toddlers on top of that I told them that I would like to keep my 9-5 schedule and I have communicated to them long time ago that I prefer not to close but still they’ve put me on a closing shift. She made a sly comment saying “ugh I wouldn’t want to be in toddlers, I think I can be with infants” since I felt like we were in a joking kind of conversation I responded to her jokingly “don’t be fooled”(about the infants) apparently the same parent mentioned this to my director and was pretty much told by my director and asst. director to avoid parents at all costs and to shut up and just be very positive. side not our previous lead teacher called cps and licensing on this place. There are so much other dramas that went on but it’s too long to add here.Now I feel awful since all I just care about their child but don’t meant anything by it. But I dislike working at this place and I’m really unhappy which is why I’m leaving. I’m so traumatized after I was called into the office for this reason. I feel even worse that I’m on my last week and I feel so attacked. This place has caused me so much anxiety all throughout my stay. I guess my unhappiness is reflecting on the way I communicate?  I’m really sad about this whole thing and I feel like I cannot show my face to them anymore. Also cause I feel so betrayed and that they don’t have my back after all the crappy ways they’ve treated me. I don’t know what to feel and think anymore.

During my first few years, I hopped around a bit: I taught in a small CA Catholic middle school, a rural Virginia middle school, a small CA private secular K-8 school. Then I moved to NYC and I taught at a large Title 1 high school NYC closed down, a new small Title 1 grades 6-12 NYC public school (aftermath of the closing down) for 9 years. I then moved South and taught in Maryland at two charter schools, one located in DC. I then took a job at a very large (academically) high performing suburban Maryland high school. All have their strengths and weaknesses, upsides and downsides. If you are someone who craves meaning and seeing a relatively immediate positive impact on others as I do, I advise frustrated teachers to try a variety of settings and, if you can, and move when things get stale before giving up on the profession completely. Also, don't be afraid to switch subjects. I taught math at the private schools, got bored, and then got certified in English. Middle school kids were driving me crazy so I picked up an ESOL license through Praxis, allowing me to teach any grade. Later I did the same with social studies. This helped me get away from the massive amounts of grading. Happy now although I sometimes miss my colleagues and the family-like environment from the high pressure Title 1 schools.

1690122208.0,I got a write up during the summer for having anxiety,"So, it seems I need a new way to share my vents, my frustrations, my joys just all of it.  So, let me give a little back story.  Last year at the end of the year we learned that we had 3 APs leaving, one being my evaluator and the other two being over scheduling along with our director of Special Education who I bonded with this year as a first-time small group teacher.  This mean that for the first time since I've been working at this school I left with no clue of what I might be teaching next year and absolutely no idea as to who I'll be working with in my direct chain of command.  

A friend of mine put up a post about all the changes he wants to make to improve himself and his school year this year.  I commented telling them I was anxious because of the information above.  That's when I learned a few things.  1) They have a teacher rat on their FB.  2) My fears about this principal which had been subsided after their being here for two years were actually founded. 3) Having anxiety is a negative reflection of the school and a violation of social media policy (WTF!!!!).

So, obviously someone had to tell the principal what I commented because per social media policy both our accounts are friends only and the principal isn't a friend on either account.  So, I get a call from the principal berating me for having anxiety about the year.  Accusing me of being ungrateful because they had fended off issues and defended me as a teacher last year (um as long as I'm not doing anything wrong isn't that their job?).  The icing on the cake though was their telling me that if I have anxiety, I should be going to a therapist to fix my problems not sharing them with coworkers because they can't be on any assistance to my mental health.",TeacherReality

Everyone is stressed, off sick, injured from pupil assault. Ya know. Normal. 

Workload has been ratcheted up constantly because the school appointed some middle leaders from the money they don't seem to have. They need to justify their position so they've been making paperwork exercises. 

Teachers. Classic teachers. Fucking teachers. 

Meeting starts. We are told we will be creating a 900/1000 word planning document every half term based off *planning that is already online*. Yes. So we're going to copy and paste the content into a document, add some word soup and promises of differentiation that will probably not happen. 

Teachers all nodding. The same teachers who complain about workload and understand there's no time for this. I'm looking around wondering if they've done the translation yet. It roughly translates to 

""hey fuckers, you know that holiday you get to try and rebuild your shattered mental health?... how about we take another day of it off you... because this pointless fucking document HAS to be on the system by 9am on the first day. Not for students. For us""

No one says anything. The cat flap in an elephant house effectiveness senior leaders grin mindlessly knowing more work is being done. That must be good right? Do they wonder how much more work can be ratcheted up? No. Because that would require an understanding of management beyond unrealistic ungrounded mindless aspirations based on falsity.

1686837821.0,Career Advice,"Hi All, 

I work for a large urban district. We are surrounded by smaller suburban districts that do pay significantly more money (with less education requirements for top salaries). Here’s the catch: my district pays significantly more from years 1-10, it’s only after that point where the suburban districts leave my district in their dust.

For example, with a master’s plus 60 credits (or three master’s degrees, or one doctorate), my district’s top base salary is $105k after ten years. A suburban district will pay a base of $125k after 15 years with only a master’s plus 30 credits.

My salary is increasing by $6k starting this summer, but if I went to this suburban district at the equivalent salary step, my income would basically be the same as it was this year. 

So what would you do? Take a pay cut for a decade to reap the higher salary for the second half of your career, or decrease your total career’s earnings by about $300k and stay in the current district?

Thanks!",TeacherReality
1686712632.0,Blackout protest,"So... Elephant in the room: Why hasn't
r/TeacherReality joined the Reddit protest when so many adjacent subs have? The mod team hasn't spoken about it, so this is just me talking. But there is stuff worth saying.

First and foremost reason, in my mind, is that the community has not called for it. The first meta thread about the protest on the sub was posted today. If/when the community calls for action, the community will decide and we moderators will follow. What ""decided"" looks like in a site filled with bots and alts is a bit hard to nail down, but the decision rests with the community, not its moderators.

Second, I mod a few subs, one of which has joined the protests (the others are too small for it to be much impact either way). I would say that the purpose of *that* sub is entertainment, which is not the reason *this* sub exists. 

Our primary purpose is to offer a place for teachers to receive support in the tough choice many make to leave the profession. Summer is the time when many make that choice. When someone leaves their school, they may be leaving their support system, their friends, and reevaluating much about their life. This is a place to remind them that they still have value (both economic and *human* value). I don't want to shut down that life line just when someone might need it.

I've been teaching for 19 years-- I'm going to keep teaching-- but I've seen too many colleagues and friends broken, by what was the toughest choice they ever faced, for me to pull the rug out from under anyone who needs the help-- even for a moment. There are school admins, HR departments, and even colleagues out there who will make people feel like their humanity and wellbeing is a small price to pay for test scores-- we are a counter narrative to that.

Does that excuse anything Reddit is doing? No. I am personally horrified, especially by the shutdown of apps that provide accessibility where Reddit does not. 

If the sub decided that it was time to go dark, would I press the button? Sure. 

Is that my decision to make? I don't think so.

Any feedback is appreciated.",TeacherReality

He is extremely supportive of teachers, he is also certified in ELA and Math and will happily take over a class if needed. He LOVES confrontation (meaning, get an angry parent to calm down), coaches several sports and the students love him. He is the first one in the school and the last one out. This man is so dedicated, a great leader, teacher and colleague. 

Our school has two campuses. The other one is a huge mess and all the middle school teachers threaten to walk out. My principal was asked to intervene and help for a few weeks. And I guess their principal is now gone. 

HR decided to move him to that campus. I am pretty sure he is not happy about that. I know he loves his school and he complained about the other campus a lot. They didn't give him a choice. 

We do not know what the board is going to decide as to who is going to be our principal.

We had a standing meeting last Monday to learn that over the weekend one of our students parents called the police because he found a pistol and AR in the kids bedroom. Upon further investigation admin found out there was a TikTok of this kid showing his buddy the guns in the school bathroom the week before. The day this kid brought them to school he was supposed within the first 32 minutes for flipping off a teacher. Based on his history we believe he intended to use them.

What did admin do? Sent out communication to parents 3 days after telling staff about it but said ""weapon"" even though we clearly knew it was a gun. Also, this situation could have been completely avoided because the kid sold pot gummies on campus the second week of school. He should have been charged with a felony and expelled then. No, we let him stay and be spent 27% of his year causing enough issues to be suspended. The kid that took the video in the bathroom for him? I found his TikTok and he's also a little prick. He thinks he's so tough and cool, his parents also bought him a shotgun for his birthday. Yet another kid that should've been expelled long ago for constant suspensions.

We have 1.5 days left and I feel like every day I go home I'm just thankful to still be alive. This whole event sends the message of: ""we don't care about your safety as long as these kids learn"". I signed a contract in a new district for next year and cannot wait to be out.",TeacherReality
1684463829.0,Positive Reinforcement?,"Positive Reinforcement.

How can you use positive reinforcement on a child who is received many warnings about being mindful about their body and surroundings but still constantly get hurt.  It has been going for 3 weeks.

I got so frustrated that I let the child know that I am scared to take them on summer field trips. If there is a 4th week I will put my foot down and ask one of their parents to go with. But ik for a fact they won't bother to come. They NEVER have.

ANYWAYS

No shock today and with my luck they went home and had a limp but didn't tell staff. And I get a message from mom along with my much now regretted statement of "" I'm scared to take them on field trips."" (Let mom know it was regrettably mentioned)

 I've already noted and know that they get overly excited before the transition to outside or new activites. I ask them to walk to the ""calm couch"" and to show me what relaxed and clam means. (If they are not running they are stomping and angry/screams because I am asking them to relax & calm down and even then the success rate is maybe 65%)
But this morning and my luck, they run to the couch and adds in a head into the wall. 

How do you turn running into the wall a positive reinforcement situation even after many warnings and told what behavior is to be expected? (*** please walk to the calm couch and relax) I've done my part to see what triggers cause these actions but its following through directions and listening isn't going though. 

Maybe I say and do ""I see that you ran into the wall, that's why the direction was to walk. Here is a hug,ice pack and an hour me panic observing to make sure you don't have a concussion"" 

Where do I add the ""rewarding or reinforcing desirable behavior in order to increase the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated in the future""?(google)

SO 

In my response, I told her ""How does after a couple of reminders to *** about being mindful of how our surroundings can affect our body or the choices that we make can affect our body. We can have *** sit next to a teacher for a calm break until *** is ready to try again."" 
 But it's still the same strategy I have used just different places and clearly it's not positive enough. Obviously reminders only can go so far. 


As for ""how is his body awareness"" he walks around and says genitalia terms like its nothing. (Not often and is corrected and told when is and where is the appropriate time to say those terms) He's well aware of what IS where and whats IS there. IM SURE he is aware of his body.",TeacherReality

Yesterday, my district received mass threats to middle schools throughout the district. Parents were advised to speak with their children and student absences were all excused. Here’s where i’m fucking pissed:

We, as their teachers, were not given ANY information. We were not told which schools received a threat (it’s a big district) and we were not told exactly what the threat entailed. We were also NOT encouraged to stay home like students were. they didn’t acknowledge us at all, actually. I was literally sobbing this morning on my way to work because I was so terrified. I said goodbye to my husband, my cats, my best friend and parents, hell I even drafted a goodbye note for my best friend to give my husband “just in case”!!!

Maybe it was stupid of me to not call out immediately, but we live in such a society where I feel BAD for wanting to protect MY OWN LIFE over the lives of other peoples kids that I have no relation to. Don’t get me wrong, I adore my students but I JUST got married. I JUST turned 25 (literally yesterday, got the email at my literal birthday dinner so that was fun /s) I have had unrelated health issues recently that has caused me to miss multiple days so close to the end of this school year and i felt bad calling out when I “didn’t need to” 

My roommate woke up to see me walking out the door sobbing my eyes out and so I told them what was going on and why I was still going in. How I didn’t know which schools were under threat and it was a small chance it was my school since the district was so big so “it will probably be fine” They told me to text my principal and ask if she had more info (this hadn’t even occurred to me, idk why) and she responded that it was in fact our school that was directly under threat. I told her immediately that I was staying home which thankfully she understood and wasn’t upset at all. 

It just PISSED me off that we as teachers got NO INFORMATION. There was nothing communicated that we were under investigation or called out. I had to ASK. Why didn’t they just close the school down?!? I spent the entire day stressed out of my mind and looking at the news every hour to see if there were any updates. We ended up getting a district wide email saying that the poster was arrested and would be charged accordingly, and thank fucking god that nothing happened but what the hell has america come to?! I shouldn’t have to go to work teaching CHILDREN afraid for my fucking life and saying goodbye to my husband and family! I’m beyond pissed off.",TeacherReality

1677549397.0,"Here's My Experience: I have no one to tell, so I'll tell you.","I need to express what I'm going through somewhere, and this seems like an okay place to do it. I often see people posting here in a rather negative way about students, but to be honest I don't find the students to be what makes this a punishing job. I became a teacher through TFA, so I have only worked in Title I schools. Fights break out, property gets damaged, and students can be generally noisy, mean, and way less mature than society expects, but I find that the way I treat students has a huge influence on how they respond to me. I have noticed at the schools I have worked at that the teachers most likely to complain about how horrible students are happen to be teachers that are mean and sometimes say dehumanizing things to students. They also happen to be teachers who are pretty ""old school"", and don't feel like its worth their time to bother keeping up with best practices in the field.

In short, I'm pretty new at this but student behavior is not something I prioritize as a problem. It may be that I came into teaching as what TFA calls a ""career changer"", and I am bringing my previous experience with me, which has happened to be pretty helpful in the classroom.

What makes this job such a demoralizing and demeaning experience is the school district... well, the system in general. There is just too much about how education works that honestly just seems like a stupid idea. What feels good to say is that the district seems like it's run by idiots.

When I started writing this post, I expected that I would be able to explain some of why I believe this. But now I'm running out of time to write, and I don't even know where to start because it's so overwhelming. I have worked in about two dozen organizations and I have never seen anything approach the level of incompetence and dysfunction that I am observing in this school district, full of people none-the-wiser going about their business as if this stuff was normal.

There are lots of valid criticisms about Teach For America, but one thing that they seem to do well is to expose incoming teachers to the most current practices in teaching, and give you a pretty formidable crash course on theory. One would think that a summer crash course on literacy education and pedagogy is but a humble beginning compared to the experience of education leaders who have a decade or more under the belt. This is what I believed. 

I shit you not, I have come to the slow awareness over my time teaching that the TFA crash course plus my previous work experience and unrelated degree have left me more prepared to do this right off the bat than a lot of people seem like they are after years. I do not feel proud of myself and am not bragging about this. Rather, it's the story of a slow horror that has been making itself known to me. Like, really? How is it that I have a better idea of how to do this than the people whose jobs are allegedly to tell me how to teach?

I have educators in my life that are inspiring, and I admire some public leaders in education as well. Of all the people who have a say over what I am doing (there are about seven *seven* ***SEVEN PEOPLE*** observing my classroom and leaving orders for me---no wait... EIGHT) one. *one.* **ONE OF THEM** is a person who obviously has good leadership skills, builds relationships with students and teachers skillfully, is extremely knowledgeable about teaching practices AND gives amazing feedback. ONE OF THEM, and it's the one that gets bulldozed the most by the others because this person is at the bottom of their hierarchy.

Could be worse. I trust my administrators' intentions and I like them. I've been disappointed by some of their decisions---I don't know what makes them think that asking me to explain my lessons over and over is a more helpful use of time than letting me reflect and come to our coach for feedback (coach with specific and recent experience in my subject area, or admin without experience in this core subject... which is more helpful?), or what makes them think that scolding me (""you better do it!"") is a good way to get the results they want from me when I am a grown-ass adult who is clearly intrinsically motivated to grow in this role. Actually, does anyone really need to be harassed into doing this job? Is it even possible? Who is even left teaching besides people who are stuck waiting for retirement and people who have some good personal reasons to even try it? I think that when they feel harassed and infantilized by their bosses, they decide to just pass it on.

As far as admin are concerned, that job is absurdly hard and overwhelming, but administrators who don't learn to fully trust the people who are working under their authority are just going to make it harder for themselves. That's true in every organization. 

Why my administrators feel that way is because they themselves have to report to a micromanaging hierarchy of people who maybe aren't people's favorite to work with. One would imagine that being a psychopath and sadist is a prerequisite for work in that department. There are so many cooks in the kitchen... I mean, we could totally better use that money to hire coaches and ESE teachers, but my district instead decided to create an out-of-touch, pompous hierarchy. Instead of sending work down the hierarchy, there are FOUR levels of this hierarchy that directly engage with us at the classroom level. They don't say anything---they mostly seem to try to avoid interacting with teachers. But they have opinions. And this entire organization is run according to their opinions. Not policy, not a concrete and transparent set of criteria... just their often inconsistent opinions. So we are left scrambling at the bottom to meet their often different expectations, which are sometimes incompatible with each other.

Their opinions are the worst. They insist that we adopt these awfully lazy teaching practices that they think are good teaching. They think they are rigorous. Putting their ideas to work in my classroom only makes things worse. I did it because I was sure I'd collect data on how it's worse, and I do have some. But now no one is interested in looking at my data. lol.

I teach students in historically poor neighborhoods. The overwhelming majority are from recently immigrated families or African-American families. I have students that have extremely poor self-management skills, short attention spans, and I imagine are neurologically under-stimulated and under-developed. For these students, a lot of scaffolding is important. I cannot simply put a grade-level text and a bunch of multiple choice questions in front of them and hope for the best, or ask them to read independently and shrug if they fall behind. That only works if they value education and are intrinsically motivated themselves. If they don't... well god forbid they appear to have fun in class, or that I spend a necessary amount of time getting them to buy into what I'm teaching so that it actually sticks, or that I give them a little agency so that they are treated like human beings for a while and practice making decisions about their learning. This is exactly what all the relevant experts and sources that I trust say I need to do, but the bureaucracy of child-hating psychopaths is not into it. They have the fewest complaints when what I'm doing looks like test-prep, which let's be honest bores the shit out of me and you, so definitely bores the shit out of my struggling students.

Not all my students are far below grade level. Some of them are at or above grade level. At some of the more highly-regarded schools in my district, their mastery would probably be seen as mediocre. However, relative to other students at my school, these guys are doing their best to aim high. In this group of students, I have students who have unbelievably bad situations at home and have to struggle with difficult family conflicts. They are emotionally affected by these things. Some of them struggle to be motivated. They might be the first English-speaking generation in their family. There are so many students that are driven and gifted. They go through the year barely turning any work in, and then BOOM they turn in something that demonstrates an impressive level of insight and creativity, maybe because they happened to have a good week and were better able to rise to their potential. They would soar so high if we only took notice and helped them overcome the obstacles that are holding them back.

Being responsive to the needs of either of these groups of students, which both make up the majority of my students, is not an important part of teaching according to the useless wastes of public money that have the most influence over what happens to them. When I try to do something to be responsive to my students according to best practices that I can cite, I tend to get reprimanded, called ""outside of the box"" for playing it safe according to science, get called ""rogue"" for letting my relationship with my students and all the data I get from that inform my teaching.

I have never felt as disrespected, demeaned, demoralized as a professional. I have never worked for people so ignorant. Their incessant demands for compliance with their unclear and contradicting instructions (how do you comply successfully with something that contradicts itself, anyway?) are oppressive and just wrong. They are so short on teachers, but I don't think they got the memo on that because they treat us like we are expendable. I already have another career and I am testing the waters through a TFA commitment... why the hell would I want to actually continue working under these conditions? 

If someone paid me to organize AGAINST this bureaucracy of clowns and identify them as the enemy of the people that they are I would take that job.",TeacherReality

1676670729.0,I made my VP cry today,"TLDR: I brought an error to the VPs attention and she responded by not fixing it and crying. 


In my district to handle sub/teacher shortages, teachers cover for absent teachers during their prep periods. We are supposed to have a union negotiated equitable rotation of teachers covering. My school in particular is terrible at it. People on the “leadership” team (deans, counselors, coaches, the vice principal and the principal) and school darlings rarely if ever are covering. 

Recently I complained that the space I’m reaching out of (I am a special education teacher, the only one in my building without their own class room) is being misused and it has become super disruptive to my students.

Since then, I have been covering almost every day and had three prep periods I wasn’t covering during in the past two weeks. 

Yesterday morning when I saw I was covering again, I asked the VP (who as part of her duties is supposed to create these schedules) why I had another coverage as it doesn’t make sense given the rotation. She responded that because of call outs EVERYONE was being used. Looking at the coverage sheet, this was obviously untrue but I let it go because I had stuff to do and I’m not interested in arguing with her.

Today, I sat in my car waiting for the daily coverage schedule to come in through email before going in. When I got it and saw I had lost my prep period again, I checked and made sure there were other people on the same rotation as me available. I already knew from checking yesterday that they should have been ahead of me in the rotation. None of them were covering, none of them had scheduling conflicts. There was no obvious reason it should have been me again. 

So armed with all this, I walked into the building and attempted to talk to my vice principal. I am NOT a confrontational person, and honestly part of why I’m dealing with not having a classroom and being used for coverages so much is because I am a very easy going person at work(I’ve learned my lesson now though). 

So I calmly tell my vice principal “VP, I covered 2nd grade Tuesday, 8th grade yesterday and you have me on the schedule for Kindergarten today. There are other sped teachers who have not had coverages at all this week.” (I had the ok to mention this from these teachers because everyone is aware of this issue and I’ve had all their backs before) 

And my vice principal starts crying and says “I’m sick and I’m here! And principal has said she will pay someone else to make the coverage schedule because I don’t want to do it anymore!” 

She wasn’t yelling but was loud, everyone is looking at us, I didn’t want to lose my shit so I just turned around and walked out of the office. I heard she starting crying more after I left and said “all the sped teachers hate me”

The absolute insanity of this situation is too much. Imagine someone bringing an error you made to your attention and responding by crying and telling them your job is too hard? I still lost my prep. She hasn’t said anything to me since. I’ve interacted with the principal since then and other leadership people who were there and everything was fine.

Idk what I want to do from here. I did talk to my union rep about it, they said they would address it but i am seriously just mind blown by the whole situation.",TeacherReality

1674780133.0,Nobody told me that tattoos would a problem,"Edit: dress code was brought up extensively during my interview it was never mentionned, I asked the specific rules of dress code teachers. Yes, asking about tattoos didn't occur to me as I never had to cover them before, my parents are teachers and covered in tattoo, it didn't even cross my mind. I also had a 1h phone chat with HR prior to my hiring and we talked, again, about teacher dress code extensively, tattoos were still not brought up. I feel deceited. 

I just started a new position as an ELA teacher in a charter (secular) middle school. The position has been vacant for nearly 2 years. I am highly qualified and they absolutely love me, they were desperate to hire me and paid my buyout for leaving my previous school.

Today a colleague, who also has a lot of tattoos, told, very nicely, me to cover up my arm tattoo, that it was against school policy.

I was told about dress code, which is slightly stricter than what I am used to, but I have no issues with it. I talked to HR for weeks (it was hard to break my old contract) never the tattoos were mentioned, and I have tattoos on my fingers! Idk if they were completely oblivious to them...

Should I pretend I don't know the rule? Also if I am told to cover them, which is ridiculous, none of my tattoos are offensive, the finger ones are a moon and a sun, the arm one is our local skyline, and the ones that will become visible in the summer are flowers, should I really cover them?

I live in Southern AZ and in August it can be over 115 degrees, I absolutely cannot teach in long sleeves!! And I will probably start coaching soccer, outdoors. 

What are they going to do? Fire a good teacher they had trouble finding and leave the classroom empty until they find replacement again? I'm the only ELA teacher of the entire school.

This is 2023 I don't know a single person my age who is not tattooed, it's absolutely ridiculous.",TeacherReality

1674754162.0,Leaked Video Chats With Inmate BF Caused Vet. Florida Teacher To Resign,"A veteran teacher, Donna Barber was so embarrassed she decided to resign swiftly. She was employed at the Franklin County School District for 30 years and was near retirement. 

Everything in her life was going well— she had a boyfriend who she communicated with very often. Donna Barber’s boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, was an inmate at the local prison. 

Donna Barber and her boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, would often video chat. By the way——-their video chats were steamy. On some occasions, Donna Barber would remove her clothes and participate in explicit conversations while on the job.

Once again, Donna Barber worked in a school with children. I’m not quite sure about the specific age or grade level. However, the inappropriate acts and verbal exchange in the workplace is off limits especially a school setting. 

Since, Lawrence Ray was an inmate he was breaking the rules, too. There’s strict rules that he disobeyed during their frequent calls.

Also, Donna Barber’s actions weren’t criminal as mentioned by the local state attorney. But….. the Franklin County School District began to investigate where her calls took place and the timing which were during school sessions.

According to the online records, Donna Barber was told that the school board would recommend termination. Since, her video chats were leaked to the public-she swiftly resigned. She nearly had a great retirement with pension and full benefits.

1674585850.0,Vent RE reference,"Just have to quickly vent that the first AP I emailed about writing me a reference turned me down. I was an ESL teacher at several inner city Title 1 schools for 3 years. I had to leave over a year ago when my parents were both facing life -threatening health problems, multiple heart attacks and Covid. (I had requested unpaid leave, 4 times, FMLA and board approved, but our system was so overwhelmed that nothing was ever processed, so eventually I had no choice but to resign.)

The nature of being a floater doing pull-out at multiple schools means no one is in a great position to write you a reference.

However, the AP in question was the most recent to observe me and gave me a satisfactory review.

I also spent many extra hours per day at the start of the pandemic helping her contact all families about devices and WiFi hotspots and update complex excel charts for her supervisors and so on. Unpaid, of course, just an extra admin duty I agreed to help with.

I just can’t believe that after all the blood, sweat, and tears I put into that job, plus spending hundreds if not thousands of my own money in supplies, that she can’t cough up a generic reference!

I loved the kids, but I’m regretting ever going above and beyond at that job. It nearly destroyed my health. So glad to be free.., but I need references to get back into teaching, and it would be nice if my admin would step up just a bit!

Anyone else in this boat??

1674102926.0,A student stole $40 from me 6 weeks ago. Shouldn’t the school reimburse me?,"It’s not even a question that he stole it. I had three twenties folded together in my pocket, and when I took my keys out, they dropped on the floor. As I was bending over to pick them up, the student I was talking to (14) bent over to pick them up first. I thought, “That’s awfully nice of him, picking up something for a man in his 50s!” But, no. He goes, “Finder’s keepers!” then walked out into the hall. 

I said, “Ha, ha. Very funny. Please give me back my money,” but he only handed me $20. I said, “What about the other $40?” He said there wasn’t any more, then turned around and put the $40 in his underwear. Because he had gone into the hall, we got very clear security footage of him doing that, so the dean, my boss and I got his mom on speaker and we all pleaded with him to hand it over. He refused. After about 10 minutes, I went back to class because I had work to do. As I was leaving, my boss said, “Sorry that happened to you.”

They suspended him for the remaining two hours of the day, but he refused to leave, meaning he got to spend the day in the building without going to class, which is what he does all the time, anyway. So, essentially he faced no consequence. During that time, he admitted to the dean that he stole it but couldn’t give it back because he “lost” it.

At his re-entry meeting, we again tried and failed to get my money back. He says his mom told him she would have done the same thing which I totally believe because I never even got an apology from her, much less the money her kid stole. The dean has been advocating for me to get reimbursed but gotten nowhere. I also asked the principal and didn’t even get a response. 

So, I put in my two weeks. I don’t have another job lined up and probably won’t go back into education, but fuck that. Seventeen years experience as a special ed teacher, an MA, and certifications in ELA and Social Studies / History, but they’re willing to throw that away for $40. I guess a job requirement for teaching now is a willingness to be robbed? I also just can’t teach this child any more because every time he wants something from me, all I can think is, “Oh, you want a pencil? Use the $40 you stole from me to buy a whole box.”",TeacherReality
1674060069.0,Teacher shortages prompt Bridgeport to consider moving students from Wilbur Cross to Thomas Hooker,"Cross needs 5 teachers, including a K Sped teacher and Resource Room, and the parents are livid.

Unfortunately, the district doesn't provide Sped teachers access to their online curriculum, and tell them to 'develop their own'. They also ignore IEP's and refuse to provide paras, which when they exist are paid $25,000. 

This, of course would be possible if $ was spent on lots of Teacherpayteacher worksheets, or if the teachers were professors at top schools with lots of money and help from interns. When I tweeted to the superintendent that he should rethink this issue, I was blocked from his official account.

1673817358.0,feeling horribly guilty for leaving my current school for another one,"I'm currently working for an alternative high school for at risk students. I want to leave because of ridiculous expectations from the corporates and the lack of community/spirit (I like most of my colleagues, but they are definitely not my friends and some colleagues really do make my days difficult). I am underpaid for my qualifications, our health plan is a patchwork of ridiculous plans that no doctor ever understands so I spend ALL of my lunch breaks on the phone with various providers to try to get simple doctor's visits covered. I have no retirement plan and I just arrived to the US with no saving and no plan for retirement. I keep getting undermined by corporates, colleagues can't put on their left sock on without me despite their seniority in the school (I've only been with them for a year and a half), more and more busy work with no real goal or growth out of them. Because of low enrollment I am incredibly bored. We also only have winter break, no fall or spring break. They often give holidays to the kids but make us come to school all day to ""plan"". No team building, we don't even have a break room, just. Meeting room with no window that happens to have a fridge and microwave. I spend my lunch breaks in my car!

So I have so many reasons to leave. But I feel so guilty, and I'll miss my students so much, because I do really love my students, they are the best part of the job. I feel guilty I am leaving a school that currently can't function without me. But at the same time I'm going to a school that needs me even more!

The new school has teachers my own age, happy students, spirit and community. It has a retirement plan and a real health insurance to offer as well as gas stipends, and more pay. AND I'll be able to put my daughter in pre-k there which will save me at least 10k!!!!! My days will be shorter. At the moment I only get 20min a day with my daughter, in the new school I would get an entire afternoon with her nearly everyday. And I can tutor for $25/h whenever I want which is really nice and I would still be home earlier than I am now.

So many reasons to be happy, and leave my current school behind. But the amount of backlash I am about the receive when I announce my departure, I'm also not giving notice as I am in an at will state and the school will withhold my last paycheck according to my contract (f them I'm not going to work for free!) so I will literally be gone overnight. And the disappointment of my students who are fragile teenagers who look up to me and who I absolutely adore... Urgh

In my decade of education I have had students who have experienced essentially every type of trauma you can imagine. 1 of my elementary students was murdered by his mother’s boyfriend. A 9 year old committed suicide. And another drowned in his bathtub after being drugged by his mother and then left unattended. 

I was hospitalized twice for injuries inflicted on me by students. I was told by my principal that getting a concussion from being head butted by a student was a REASONABLE EXPECTATION of my job. 

I had a complete mental breakdown a few months ago. I went through a severe bout with anxiety and depression and had to choose between my well-being or this job.

And here’s the kicker- I gave this job everything I had until I completely fell apart. When I had to resign because my physical and mental health were at serious risk, my principal didn’t even bother to respond to my resignation and just sent out an email to the staff about the logistics of covering my caseload. We are all completely indispensable. 

I honestly can’t believe I got out. A huge weight has been lifted, and this is the happiest I’ve been in years. I’m back to being myself. I’m back to being fun and happy.

1673367862.0,How to maintain order in my classroom when there's no support from admin?,"I'll be honest, guys.  I'm trying to leave this profession as quickly as possible.  I'm miserable.  My (middle) school is in complete disarray after a series of scandals, firings, quittings, and restructuring.  I won't get into it all here, but the result is that we're overcrowded, understaffed, dealing with an inexperienced new admin staff who create insane policies, and pure chaos from the students: daily fights, drugs, sex acts, etc. In the meantime, until I can make the switch, I'm just trying to survive.

The two biggest problems are lack of motivation/work completion and behaviors.  The first problem can be traced to a lot of things like COVID and lower standards, but perhaps the greatest cause is our school-wide policy of having to accept late work with no penalty until the end of the quarter.  I just had a student, who for the past quarter has screwed around and turned in nothing, email me a list of 10 assignments she completed, which I am forced to accept, and her grade went from a D- to a B+.  This leads to my nearly 200 students all being able to treat the entire school day as free time, then put in maybe 4 hours of effort at the end of the quarter and pass.

The second problem is bolstered by the first as well as other factors, but the result is that our admin is so overwhelmed dealing with high profile incidents, that absolutely nothing happens when a student has a minor infraction.  Dress code, talking over the teacher, food, cell phones, and games in class.  I could spend my entire day writing referrals (we don't have the authority as teachers to administer any other consequence such as a detention), but most of these referrals are ignored by admin or result in a quick 2-minute office lecture and then back to class.  Those who return to class stride in triumphantly and are admired by their peers.  Students show each other their behavior logs as a badge of honor.

What I'm left with is 6 periods a day, each over 30 students, who ignore everything I say, talk non-stop, get up and move around the room at will, sitting wherever they want, texting, throwing things, hitting each other, screaming, and me, trying hard to pretend that anyone is listening to me talk about metamorphic rocks.  Verbal warnings do nothing. Yelling does nothing. Writing kids up only encourages them.  When a parent finally concerns themselves with a student's grade, I get an email from said student listing all the assignments I should have forgotten about month's ago that I now have to spend time searching for online and grade.

What can I do to weather this storm until I can get out?  Is there any hope of having an effective seating chart and keeping kids in their assigned seats? Once again, I've spent hours upon hours writing behavior logs and referrals and speaking to admin about the problems with no success.  What can I do on my own, when there are no policies in place to support me, so that I don't feel like a prison guard who's just trying keep students' hands off each other and maintain my sanity.

I have a newish student who has been with me for a month. He is in my “reminder” category; he’s never had an accident and he will go, if needed, when I ask. 

Our sessions are 3 hours long, and I do “potty time” during centers, which is about halfway through our session. 

I asked this student if he needed to use the bathroom, and he said, “no.” Okay. 

30 minutes later, we do our second circle. He was dry at this time. 
Second circle is 20 minutes long, and parents pick up at the end. 

His mom was 10 minutes late. A few minutes later, she violently knocks on my door. When I opened it, she yelled at me because he was “soaking wet.” I told he that he was dry when circle started, and she asked how long ago that was (at this time, 30 minutes). 

Then she yelled that if it ever happens again, he won’t be coming back, and stomped away. 

I went back in and noticed a wet spot on the circle carpet.

Over the the last two years 16 people have either quit or transferred. Her and I got into a disagreement a few weeks ago due to the way she spoke to me in front of some kids and since then she has not liked me. Anyway, I was hired to be an EA in a resource room, due to the obvious nature of the job, before and during my interview (and several times after) I disclosed how I do not feel comfortable working with children who have some form of autistic spectrum disorder, of course it has nothing to do with a prejudice of any kind, just knowing myself I do not work well with individuals such as that. I was told it wouldn’t be a problem and my place in the resource room would center around some of the kids who struggle behaviorally. Well there is a child with autism who is on the case load and he requires an aid with him, the aid he originally had continuously called off and administration would have me to be his one-on-one aid. I reminded them of my disclosure but helped anyway because I am a team player. Two weeks ago they fired his aid and I agreed to help until the board could approve a new hire to take over. Last week they told the intervention specialist they were changing the way her room was ran, hiring a new EA to help her and changed my schedule to be his full time aid without talking to me at all.

Educators will be holding rallies on Saturday, first at 1 p.m. at Haverhill City Hall and then at 4 p.m. at Malden City Hall.

The HEA and MEA released the following joint statement:

“It is no coincidence that the educators in both Haverhill and Malden took votes today to authorize strikes if their respective contracts are not settled before Monday. Several unions representing thousands of educators in communities north of Boston meet regularly to discuss our working conditions, which are our students’ learning conditions. The educators in Haverhill and Malden have been working without contracts. The respective unions have made numerous proposals to address staffing shortages, racial and social justice, safety in schools, adequate time for educators to prepare and collaborate, and wages that have been chronically suppressed. The school committees in both communities are showing no interest in addressing needs we see as critical to our students’ success.

“We are saying enough is enough. Our students deserve better, our communities deserve better, and we deserve better.

“We acknowledge the disruption our strikes can cause. But we can no longer in good conscience see our students receive less than they deserve and for educators to be continually disrespected as professionals. We are ready to bargain any time to settle these contracts. Our respective school committees have the power and authority to avert these actions.”",TeacherReality
1665643908.0,Needing some advice and a rant,"Hi guys. Discovering this subreddit has been therapeutic.

I’m a first year ECT and 5 weeks in I already feel like I’m sinking. The school I’m at has a very intensive marking policy. All books marked and an assessment competed, marked and feedback given every three weeks (so twice a half term). Ive got 10 class groups so you can do the maths here…I’ve been staying up until 11 o clock two or three weeknights every week trying to get through it and I’m already not staying ahead. I got quite sick last week, and although the change of weather of course played a part I also think it was spurred on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. 

Yesterday I got pulled in by a member of SLT as a complaint that I hadn’t marked one of my student’s books. I had already marked that class’s books but the student but have been absent when I took them up. Half way through the conversation I felt like I couldn’t even hear what they were saying to me and I had a really strong urge to just leave the building.

I feel like I’ve already checked out mentally and I don’t want to stay in this job. I know it’s really bad to leave a teaching position mid year, but I truly think I could see myself having a breakdown if I stay.

If I left, I was thinking I could do supply work until my lease is up on my apartment. Or even just find work in a cafe.

1665355055.0,"Going on my second year, and I’m feeling overwhelmed to the breaking point.","Hello all,

This is going to be my second year of teaching, and I just don’t know how to handle all of what is being piled onto my plate. I know this is what I signed up for, but I’m starting to feel depressed and hopeless. I’m not looking for any advice, I just want to let out what I’ve been holding in for some time.

For a little background, I started off teaching at am elementary school near the city, and I ended up having to quit mid-year right before Christmas break because I couldn’t handle teaching at that particular school anymore. I loved my kids, but I had two that needed a lot of extra supports due to special needs and behaviors that I couldn’t provide, and neither had a para to help them while I taught. I ended up getting assaulted by one of my more challenging students, and my cries for help fell on deaf ears, so I left. It was so bad there that I ended up being on a heart monitor because I was so stressed.

I’m at a better school now, but because I left halfway through, I’m behind on mandatory LETRS training, and I feel like the pressure keeps building every single day. Every week something new is piled onto our plates and no one asks “What can we do to help you?” Or asks what they can take away from us. I spend my one hour of planning during the day grading and talking to parents and lesson planning, but more often than not I’ll have to stop because we have ten other different self-directed PDs to complete by a certain deadline. Not to mention we have an entirely new curriculum, are fumbling through it at best, and are of course dealing with behaviors that have only worsened since the pandemic. I know this is common, but I feel so burnt out and alone. I try my best to create boundaries so that I don’t work at home or on weekends, but that means I’ll be at the school until five or six. 

I just feel like breaking down and crying. I feel like I can’t even give my loved ones any attention because of my job. My boyfriend lives in another state and we are both so tired we hardly have but one call a week, I haven’t seen any of my friends in months, and my cat that I’ve had for 14 years has cancer and is dying and I feel like I don’t even have the time or energy to sit with my sadness about that. I also have lost all ability to organize and be productive. My memory gets worse and worse each day and I feel like an idiot when I forget due dates and deadlines. I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD but it is taking forever to find a doctor who will actually get me the help I need, and I feel desperate.

My plate is broken. It can’t hold anything. I want nothing more than to just teach and love my kids, but inside I feel like the whole world is caving in on me. I’m trying my best every day, but sometimes my best is just getting out of bed every morning.",TeacherReality

1664899844.0,I thought I had a great job at a great school until..,"So, I posted this as a comment to somebody’s post about admin treating them poorly but I’ve wanted to make it into a post as I’m still having trouble making sense of what happened. 

I am an educator who’s been in the field for over ten years. I’m currently getting my MA in Early Childhood Education, as this is what I teach in. I’ve been teaching preschool for the past five years and have been working at one school in particular. Last year, my supervisor left and I was asked to step up in her place. I had no prior training or experience running a preschool but I worked tirelessly with my admin day in and day out to create curriculum, build a community, maintain safety in the classrooms, and make sure the kids were well taken care of. I had built great relationships with families over the years and taught their children as well as the siblings. I was teaching a preschool 3s class and I even had a parent call to make sure I would be teaching it the following school year (this year). Since that was my class, I told her yes and she gladly told other parents who then enrolled their kids to stay in the program and continue in my class. 

During the school year I had a lot of problems with staff because most of the teachers I worked with were not teachers but more so looking for part time gigs. I heard a lot of, “well I don’t get paid enough for this shit” or “this is toddler school so it means nothing.” I also had issues with asking them to sanitize during a freakin pandemic. You would have thought I was the supervisor from hell if you asked them but I was the first director of that school that never made teachers feel guilty for calling out and told them they needed to put themselves first. I treated them like humans. I worked very closely with a teacher who was my assistant one year and then became my second in command once I stepped up. We had a great relationship until we learned she had been lying about being in grad school. Not only was this against the law, and her contract, but management didn’t want to get rid of her mid year in fear of the parents reactions.  As the months went on the lies piled up. From little white lies about prepping materials to lying about things such as being pregnant and getting surgery. I felt she was a liability but nobody took me seriously.

After such a trying and mentally exhausting year, I decided to take the summer off and return in the fall. I work at a private school so summers were not paid but you could work at the camp there. Anyways, as I was preparing to go back to the classroom, it was decided that somebody who was more qualified to be director would take over my responsibilities, and being in grad school at the time, I was ok with this. My management told me I should be focusing on grad school, which they were paying for and said I needed my masters in order to grow there. 

Fast forward to the end of summer, I tell them I got approved for student teaching and would be out of the classroom one day a week in a school my grad school placed me in. It was not up to me and I couldn’t do it at my work site. 
Once that was said, they told me I “wouldn’t be happy returning” and that they needed someone full time in the classroom even though it would only be for one semester AND they would have the staff to cover the one three hour shift a week when I wasn’t there. I figured out that once they realized they could use my salary to hire more shitty teachers as bodies, they decided they didn’t need me anymore. I rarely pat myself on the back but I did everything for them and I was honestly a model teacher. Even when parents called them angrily after hearing I wasn’t returning, they still didn’t seem to budge. 

All I wanted was to continue teaching the 3s class and as an even bigger slap in the face, they ended up giving my class to the teacher that had been lying to everyone all year. 

Basically, I’m writing this because I’ve been losing sleep over it and I’m so angry at them for kicking me to the curb. I did EVERYTHING for them. I kept a school open during Covid. I wrote their entire curriculum. I stayed up late at night with my Cricut machine making stickers and prepping activities for my kids on the regular. I built incredible relationships with families, but, I guess it wasn’t good enough? I’m still in grad school but now I’m second guessing everything. Do I even want to do this anymore? Am I a good enough teacher? I still feel so broken about it and it’s been a month now. 

Truly, I’d love to enter the field of education policy one day so I can work for the true MVPs, the mother fucking teachers. We deserve more than management could ever understand and it’s just..

So. 
Damn. 
Frustrating. 

Maybe I just needed to vent but honestly, any advice is helpful.

Imagine if you were able to choose educators the way that you choose who cleans your child's teeth, or serves as your nurse in a hospital.

Teachers had to come to school masked while students roamed freely maskless. Our COVID sick days were reduced to 5 per year. I took medical leave for 2 weeks and ended up losing over half my monthly paycheck because the rate to pay subs is higher than my daily rate.  Had a high school kid threaten to shoot up the school during my class. Kid is returned to my class weeks later. I had no explanation of what happened during that time. Same year had a 4 hour bomb threat lockdown where students were peeing in buckets and other containers bc we couldn’t go in the hall. Thanks to tik tok, Kids were vandalizing bathrooms so most bathrooms were locked up, causing students to need to miss class for 15 min just to find the nearest bathroom. Also thanks to tik tok, it was a trend to sexually assault your teacher by smacking them on the butt. A parent wanted to interview me for what I was teaching for the ENTIRE YEAR and I was required to attend that interview. We were asked to do janitorial duties because janitors were asked to work holidays for $11/hour and so they all quit. I teach ceramics and the room lacked safe ventilation. I didn’t have my own classroom, or an office for planning and it’s kind of necessary when your an art teacher to prep materials in the room you teach in. I have a masters with 8 years of certification and was being paid less than 55k per year in one of the most expensive cities in the USA. With health insurance and everything else deducted, I was barely taking home 3500 per month. What makes this worse is that teachers are bound to an annual contract that only benefits school districts (did you know they can just move you to another school at will if they choose? Or make you teach at two schools in one day so you have to travel for lunch?) They try to make it seem like breaking a contract will ruin your career and teachers do buy into this myth.  I left teaching that year to work remote in tech in an entry level job and already get paid more after 4 months of being here.

Sure, there's always current material to relate, but that isn't the point.  Do kids even read books anymore?  Should I assign worksheets and outlines, or short videos to watch instead?

Im an introvert with social anxiety and i feel like my job takes up all of my energy, it is exhausting. Dont get me wrong, i love my kids and i dont feel anxious when im in front of the classroom teaching idk why. When i get home from work, i rest for abit and then do more work to prepare for work the next day. I hate this about the job, its like endless work. Maybe if i stick to teaching at the same school it will get better?

I also feel like im teaching kids to constantly conform to rules and not question them (how to sit or speak or behave or dress or write). Its like teaching a bunch of unique individuals to act or think the same way. Idk if im overthinking this, i jst feel like im shaping these kids to be part of the machine. The kids who question the system or the rules are considered “naughty” or “disrepsectful” and must be punished. If they dont write their essay in the structure that was taught, they wont do well.

refused. I closed the door and they began banging on both of the doors. At one point my aide opened the door, which I was standing in front of. The student then
grabbed the handle and began yanking the door handle which in turn caused the door to push me over and over again. At this point the AP showed up and the student cussed me out. Is this assault? Idk what to do. I've been teaching for 8 years and I've never experienced this.",TeacherReality

I was let go that same year because I “wasn’t doing enough” according to admin. I was upset at their reasoning but felt relief as I didn’t love teaching anyway.

I decided to take the following year off of teaching and started to look for other jobs. I have a very specialist degree and two very specialist credentials. From September to May of last year I applied to hundreds of jobs for onboarding or HR and never even got an interview. I was an emotional wreck at this point and gave in and applied to one of the better private schools for the subject I teach. 

I got the offer and accepted it. I was so excited to be done job searching. As the start of the school year has gotten closer I’m DREADING the start of the school year. I hate teaching, I’m good at it and students like me but I absolutely hate it. On top of that the school pays so little I’ll be going negative about $1,000 a month.

1659039144.0,Morale is low in the teacher’s lounge,"I posted a picture of the whiteboard in our teacher’s lounge a few months ago with a title to match this one, and remembered I could update our situation here again.


Principal concluded that the lounge is a ‘toxic environment’ (because we vent and discuss admin’s managerial shortcomings as well as the school problems that come as a result) so he got rid of it, saying we can share one with the school on one of the upper floors (we’re in a basement and a small school that gets bullied by the others, so we feel shy about intruding on another school.) He didn’t make his reasoning public, but I overheard him tell a custodian, “they sit in there and talk shit, they can go talk shit upstairs, I don’t have time for that.” 
Talking shit being, ‘they promised we’d have computers for students in September, it’s now March and we still don’t have anything,’ and ‘Principal cornered and verbally abused me today, here is how to protect yourself.’ We know our admin work hard and do what they can with what we have, but that doesn’t make our school not a shit-show.

***By  Zoe Yu***[ ](https://time.com/author/zoe-yu/)

***July 23, 2022 7:00 AM EDT***

***Yu is a rising high school senior and writer from Texas***

**On May 24, 19 students and two teachers were shot and killed at** [**Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas**](https://time.com/6181501/texas-school-shooting-victims-uvalde/)**—the   deadliest mass shooting in our state’s history. I remember staring at   my phone as the gut-wrenching headlines rolled in: fourth-grader** [**Miah Cerrillo**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/08/uvalde-congress-students-testify-gun-violence/) **had covered herself in her classmate’s blood to trick the shooter into thinking that she was already dead; teacher** [**Arnuflo Reyes**](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/us/uvalde-school-teacher-arnulfo-reyes-interview/index.html)**, who was shot in the arm and lung, lost 11 students in his class; and the body of 10-year-old** [**Maite Yuleana Rodriguez**](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/07/1103577387/matthew-mcconaughey-green-converse-shoes-sneakers-uvalde-maite-rodriguez) **was  so disfigured from the bullets that she could only be identified by   her lime-green Converse with a heart drawn on the right toe.  On the  news, the pictures of** [**grieving families**](https://time.com/6181718/uvalde-shooting-grieving-community/) **clinging  to one another, and of children climbing from windows and  sprinting  away from the school-turned-war zone with faces twisted in  shock and  confusion, were haunting. That same night, my friends and I  stayed up  late sharing articles and TikTok updates with the same  heaviness that  we’d felt after** [**Parkland**](https://time.com/6198426/parkland-shooting-sentencing-trial-day-one-recap/)**,** [**Santa Fe**](https://time.com/5282212/santa-fe-high-school-texas-school-shooting/)**, and** [**Oxford High**](https://time.com/6125256/michigan-school-shooting-covid/)**—now,   with the choking pain of another tragedy added to the list. It was the   dystopian familiarity of coming of age in the gun era.**

**When  I arrived at my Texas high school the next day, an administrator  was  standing at the door with a cart full of confiscated items. Of  course,  there were backpacks, which were never allowed during finals  week, but I  was surprised to see smaller bags, too—brown paper lunches,   end-of-the-year gifts for teachers—that my school had never taken up   before. Right before I could enter the building, the administrator   pointed at my laptop bag. “With what happened yesterday,” she explained   in an apologetic whisper, “we’re just on edge.”**

**I  handed over my bag without a second thought because I knew exactly how   my administrator was feeling. Like most American schools, we stop   breathing over Snapchat threats and warning messages posted to   Instagram. It’s only when the kid is caught with a gun in their pants   that we can breathe easy again, our grim relief that no one was hurt   outweighing the terror of what might have been. Because they could’ve   pulled the trigger, we face active-shooter drills that eat up entire   class periods and get trained to leave the door locked at all times, no   matter who’s begging to be let in—a peer, a principal, a best friend.   Sometimes, we even analyze hiding spots or plan for what to do if we’re   in the hallways, bathrooms, staircases, or cafeteria when the gunfire   starts, despite knowing, deep down, that nothing can really prepare us   for a moment like staring down the barrel of an assault rifle.**

**And with every school shooting—**[**27 so far, in 2022 alone**](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01)**—our fears gain legitimacy. It’s why lawmakers** [**are rallying around more armed on-campus officers**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/24/texas-republicans-uvalde-gun-control/) **and extra security checkpoints, and why Texas Republican** [**Senator Ted Cruz** ](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/sen-ted-cruz-proposes-one-door-entry-at-tx-schools-safety-experts-say-its-not-feasible)**pitched the idea of “having one door that goes in and out of the school.” Other prominent figures like** [**former President Donald Trump**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/27/donald-trump-nra-houston/) **and** [**National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre**](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/nra-wayne-lapierre-cpac-gun-rights-school-safety/2016151/) **seem to be reading from the same teleprompter flashing the same incessant buzzword: just** [**“harden” the schools**](https://time.com/6187656/school-safety-mass-shootings/)**.**

**But   while I understand that the knee-jerk reaction to violence is a push   for stronger security, I can’t help but ask questions. Why did I have to   give up my laptop bag? Why was my administrator screening for threats   like she was a TSA officer or a prison warden instead of a school   staffer? And why was my school—an educational institution—shouldering   the responsibility of checking for weapons to keep students and staff   from being gunned down?**

**Most  of all, I’m stunned that the concept of hardening schools is even a   casual talking point. To me, it feels like an admission—that gun   violence is the new normal, that school shootings will inevitably happen   again, and that there’s nothing we can do but to brace ourselves for   the next bang.**

**If  lawmakers don’t pass critical, common-sense gun laws like universal   background checks and 30-day waiting periods for gun sales that** [**are supported by the majority of Americans**](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx)**,   will students, already sandwiched between the social pressures of   fitting in and the pressure-cooker environment of academics, be forced   to brave even more active-shooter drills? Forced to resign ourselves to   the constant fear that our hallways might one day turn into a shooting   range? And on top of creating lesson plans and grading assignments,  will  teachers be expected to fend off an armed gunman,** [**a feat that even trained law enforcement officers couldn’t manage in Uvalde**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/20/uvalde-police-shooting-response-records/)**?**

**I don’t want to go through metal detectors and get my** [**clear backpack**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna862176) **searched  before taking a history test surrounded by steel doors and  bulletproof  windows. I don’t want my teachers, who are already  overworked and  underpaid, to lecture with a marker in one hand and a gun  in the other.  And I don’t want my school to be an impenetrable fortress  where I  learn how to instinctively run to the nearest exit instead of  how to  solve a math problem. It shouldn’t have to be that way for  students to  be safe at school.**

# Staffing shortage leads to involuntary teacher transfers at Montgomery County schools

 

**by John Gonzalez**

**Thursday, July 21st 2022** 

&#x200B;

 **MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. (7News) — Several public school teachers in Montgomery County say their summer break is coming to an abrupt end.** 

**Officials  with Montgomery County Public Schools have sent out a long list of  involuntary teacher transfers -- Some teachers received calls from  principals while on vacation. The union says the school system has  violated its contract.**

 **At Sherwood High School, close to two dozen staff members have been  relocated to other schools or told they will move into other positions,  with very little notice. Teachers report back to schools in about a  month.**

**7News  obtained a copy of the MCPS teacher contract, and it clearly states,  that principals will notify employees who have been involuntarily  transferred no later than Monday, February 28, 2022, and will provide  the (MCEA) education association a list of unit members identified for  involuntary transfer by the third Friday in March.**

**Also in the  contract it says, every effort will be made to notify the unit member of  the need for an involuntary transfer prior to the job fairs.**

 **In order to fill major staff shortages in other schools and cover  budget downfalls, some school electives and courses such as ESOL,  Women’s Studies and Business classes have been drastically reduced or  dropped.**

**Some 9th and 10th-grade classrooms already have 33 to 35 kids, more students than most classrooms have desks.**

**The  most recent school year ended with 581 unfilled positions countywide.  Meanwhile, 973 teachers have indicated they will be resigning or  retiring -- Which means class sizes are bound to increase.**

 **The teacher’s union says this situation violates the teacher contract --  several employees are being involuntarily transferred, receiving  surprise emails this week while on summer break. The union says they  should have been notified at least five months ago.** 

 **MCPS teacher resignations and retirements are up 38% in the past school year.**

**There are currently about 400 open teaching positions.**

**7News reached out to the school district and they sent us the following statement:**

***“School  systems across the country and throughout the region are faced with  challenges concerning open positions. One way to ensure that schools  have the employees needed is to transfer from a school with a surplus to  a school with a deficit, doing so ensures that students have the  teachers, administrators and support professionals needed. We are  working vigorously to recruit for all of our open positions, we do this  throughout the school year and are doing so now so that we begin school  fully staffed.”***

1658544603.0,Former teacher says he earns higher pay as Walmart professional,"  

**By: Maia Belay,** [**Nexstar Media Wire**](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/?post_type=profile&p=7076) 

**Posted: Jul 21, 2022 / 10:37 AM CDT** 

**Updated: Jul 21, 2022 / 11:10 AM CDT** 

 

**CANTON, Ohio (**[**WJW**](https://fox8.com/news/former-teacher-says-he-earns-higher-pay-as-walmart-professional/)**) — A former teacher said he is making more money as a Walmart professional.**

**Seth Goshorn taught for nearly six years, including at an elementary  school in Canton, Ohio, before deciding to change careers. It’s a  decision he said that led to an increase in pay by about $20,000 after  factoring in bonuses.**

**Dressed in his new Walmart uniform, Goshorn recorded a TikTok  video acknowledging the dramatic pay gap. He said the video  unexpectedly went viral.**

**“I didn’t think it would be this good. I might get a couple hundred  likes, so just the fact that it blew up and I’ve only been on it for  like a year,” Goshorn said. “It was really cool to see just the power of  the internet.”**

**Goshorn, who has a degree in early childhood education, is now  working as a “Walmart coach” on the management track. More than one  month into his new job, he said the transition was smooth.**

 

**“Last year I made about $43K teaching, so not anything terrible, but it also still left a lot to be desired,” said Goshorn.**



**He said he loved his time as a teacher and made lifelong friendships  with families. However, he was searching for a job that would better fit  his financial needs while planning an upcoming wedding with his  fiancée.** 

**Goshorn said working at Walmart provides professional growth without requiring a second degree.** 

**“My degree doesn’t exactly translate but the skills that a lot of  teachers have and the leadership ability teachers have does correlate to  a lot of companies,” he said. “So, find a company that’s willing to  train you for a position that might pay better.”**

**Goshorn does not discourage anyone from becoming a teacher and said  educators need additional support through increased salaries.**

&#x200B;

 **“Even though they’re scheduled for 40 hours, they’re working a lot  more than that, whether it’s teaching, grading after school,” Goshorn  said. “I coached football and track so those were other things on the  weekends. I did summer school. We don’t have all the time off that they  think.”**

**According to data referred to by the Ohio Department of Education,  the median teacher assignment salary statewide is $64,427. Salaries can  vary widely depending on which county and what school district a teacher  works in.** 

**Goshorn said he hopes his story serves as a teaching moment about the  power of the career pivot and the importance of supporting teachers.** 

**“I’m going to be a lifelong teacher,” he said. “That will always be a  part of my life, whether it’s at Walmart or on social media.”**

I taught for three years before becoming a full time technologist, and I'd heard some pretty wild stories back then. This app was inspired by one story in particular, where a female teacher friend of mine had to try to break up a fight during class between two male high school juniors. Not an ideal scenario. It would have been awesome to have a quick, discreet way to call for help.

In light of what happened in Uvalde and the lack of anybody doing anything about it, I'm releasing Little Red Button completely free and full featured (more features will be coming in the future). You can [download the iOS app here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/little-red-button/id1626397720) and you can [check out the website here](https://little-red-button.web.app/). A couple people have reached out about a more robust solution (eg for a special ed/SEAS school), so if that's something you're interested in, please reach out.

It's been said that one can find a lot of narcissism amongst higher academia, medicine, law and yes, school administration. All my admin had been good (mostly) until I was in my last job (which I quit).

 The principal was one of the those ""won't someone PLEASE think of the children!"" types who created a stifling, miserable environment by enacting draconian rules/guidelines that not only hurt staff but students too (e.g. requiring teachers to keep a violent child in their class and ""deal with it"" which not only was bad for the teacher, but created am unsafe space for the other kids). She also thought it was our responsibility to turn certain students who already hated school/teachers into school loving wonder kids. If we could not do that immediately, she'd torment us by questioning the ""culture"" of our classroom, w/o providing any examples or support/solutions. 
I'm not trying to rant here, but I'm crying as I write this, as I am still in heavy pain and am dealing with so much. Luckily, I found another job at a former school of mine. I still get to teach some, and I didn't have to take a big pay cut either. Thank you all so much

I found this article problematic for a number of reasons.  The headline is misleading.  apparently Texas has been doing this for a long time.  no surprise here, I'm sure, but there are record numbers of teachers leaving their schools across the country.

We all know why.  It's different state to state. But it's really all the same.  In nc, gop legislator killed the teaching fellows program, a state program that covers higher education costs for people who teach.  They killed the pay increase for teachers when they get a masters.  And they adjusted the salary schedule to decrease pensions.  

Then nationally teachers are feeling the brunt of fairy tale propaganda around a ""liberal agenda"" and indictrination... district policies around covid they have no control of.  And then the difficulties in teaching during a pandemic when you're ""distance learning"" one week, face to face the next, and students and teachers both are in and out, quarantined for a week or two at a time.  

It's been rough.  

I have an msa.  Principals license in nc.  When I got the masters, I learned enough to know I'd never want the job of principal.  I just say that to vet my comment.

To be fired, teachers have to be given due process.  When they have tenure, they have a 4th(?) Amendment right to their job.  That's why it's hard to fire shitty teachers.  Side note: most important job of a principal is to make sure the adults in your school are good for kids.  Due process and documentation make it harder.  But that's the job.

I wonder if it could be argued that they have the same property right to their teaching license?  I know Texas legislators granted Texas state Ed dept authority to revoke licenses for leaving mid year.  But I sure as hell don't like that.  

The challenges teachers are facing right now are really hard.  But policies like this seem to place the blame of empty classrooms on teachers, penalizing them for giving up after having taken so much abuse that they just can't take it any more.

It's a job.  You can quit.  You shouldn't face prosecution for leaving a job.  Can you think of any other job where that hapens?

 Contract abandonment is a spin term.  Beginning teachers can be fired without due process when the district simply doesn't renew the contract.  So they get you coming and going.  

Sorry this is so long.  I'm sure nobody made it this far.  But wasn't it Arizona that brought in the national guard as warm bodies in classrooms? Texas is trying to stem the flow by MAKING them stay... at least til the end of the school year.  There is an exodus happening.  And I'm afraid that the  budgetary needs across the nation to fix the problems will be prohibitive.

2. This country values $$ over education & thus using education as a vehicle to collect money from others is a primary goal (High cost of education)

1647692205.0,My contract wasn't renewed and I'm so devastated,"This happened on Wednesday and I am taking it so hard. I have worked at this school in 7th grade for 6 years now, 3 1/2 as a para and 2 1/2 as a special education teacher. I got my certification while working. My job is insanely hard but I work really hard and I make great connections with my students. There was never any indication given to me that I wasn't doing a good job. I never had a review (until Tuesday, after they already knew that I was being fired), there was never a conversation, I was given no chances to improve. My coworkers all support me and think that I do a good job. I know I'm still green but I really felt like I was hitting my stride this year and starting to get the hang of it. I even sent an email to my boss saying that, though she already knew I was being let go. 

On Wednesday I was called into a room (with a union rep thankfully) and told that my contract is not being renewed for next year, but they would hire me back on as a para. This is insulting because it is about a 40% paycut, there's no way I can live on that. No reason is given, and since it's been less than 5 years, I don't think they have to give me one. 

I don't bring this up to garner sympathy, but it's important for context. I found out in December that my mom had terminal cancer and that she would be starting chemo. I am super close to my mom and she lives near me, this was absolutely devastating news. I shared this with my principal because I (naively) trusted her. She acted sympathetic at the time. I have major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. All of that was in check until my mom got sick, then I really fell off the deep end. 

At the encouragement of my principal and others (I do recognize that ultimately it was my decision) I took 3 weeks of FMLA so I could pull myself together. I saw a psychiatrist, changed my meds, started making lifestyle changes, and when I returned to work I legitimately felt so much better, and I really started feeling much better about my work. 

As I said, I am too trusting and my principal is privy to a lot of my mental health struggles but I won't get into all of that. It is important to note though, that she knows things about me that others don't which is why I think it was the impetus for my firing. I think they think I'm a wreck and not worth the hassle, and don't want to be around for the fallout when my mom passes. 

No one owes me any favors because my mom is sick, but it seems so heartless and cruel, and personal. I was never put on an improvement plan and never once told that I wasn't doing something right. My school is very supportive and I reach out for help when I need it and I am constantly eager for feedback on how to improve. I'm friends with everyone in the school, I'm friendly and well liked, and now I have to say goodbye to all these people I have worked with for 6 years. 

I also have to finish out the year, so I am reminded constantly of the pain and betrayal. I have to play it straight too because I can't get ""fired"" fired. I am hurting so bad, I feel like I'll always question other's kindness now, as I feel that is ultimately what cost me my job. Special ed is in high demand and I'm a HQT for middle school ELA, so I think I'll find a job, but it doesn't make this feel any better. Sorry this was so long, it weighs on my mind a lot. 

TL;DR I got fired from my teaching job with no explanation and no opportunity to improve, probably relating to my mental health issues. I am sad about it.",TeacherReality

Yesterday, I got a pretty terrific curriculum development offer. I wanted to share what worked for me, in case it’s helpful for any other soon-to-be-former teachers. 

-When it became clear that I needed to leave teaching, I started monitoring job boards for edtech and curriculum roles. 

-However, what I found more helpful was going to the individual websites for the different curriculum companies, professional development orgs etc that I’ve come to know over the years. I made a spreadsheet with the direct links to the relevant career page for each organization, so it would be easier to keep tabs on all of them quickly. 

-Here’s where luck somewhat took over. (I’m still trying to give myself credit. [ya know, imposter syndrome] but really, this was a lot of luck.)There was a posting for *three* openings in one of my specialty areas at a curriculum organization that I’ve know for years and have grown to deeply admire. 

-I applied, and then reached out to someone I sort of knew at the organization. This person was a lead curriculum designer for another content area, but I had a feeling he might be connected to this project too. I sent him an email saying basically, “You might remember me from xyz school, now I am very I interested in joining the abc team.” And he wrote back saying that he is actually the lead for the abc team had been pleased to see my application— score!

-From there, they had me do a take home assignment and a panel interview. And yesterday, they offered me the job!

-The downside is that it’s about a $10k paycut. I live in a very HCOL area, so my teacher salary was higher than average. However, the job is remote and the hours seem very reasonable. For me, the trade off is worth it.

I’ve had the INCREDIBLE opportunity to watch my kids grow and I’m excited to see who they will become.

However. 

It has now gotten to a point where there are so many escalations and disregulated students harming others (bullying, fighting, online harassment, and just straight up not letting anyone teach by yelling out and screaming at teachers) and I have no recourse aside from calling parents. Admin seem to be in survival mode and just want to keep people from physically hurting others until the end of the year. That’s it. I know they’re overwhelmed as well.

1645493080.0,Mental Health Resources,"We all know the state of mental health in the educational system is a complete and total mess for most of us! I thought I would share two things that have kept me from a complete and total breakdown. In all honesty, I hope that this information is not new to anyone and that everyone who needs it already has access to it! In the event that is not the case here are two resources that I hope can help some of you out there. 
Many schools and unions provide an EAP (Employee Assistance Program) as part of their benefits.  An EAP is to help provide resources for employees in a variety of areas. It can be used by everyone in your household. They provide references for mental health professionals in your area and depending on your program the EAP pays for several appointments. (The programs I have used paid for between 3 and 6 appointments.) They also provide referrals for child care, legal advice, financial advice, life coaching, etc. It is also completely confidential; they legally cannot inform your employer you have even contacted them. You can call them several times. For example, if you called about a conflict with an administrator, you can get your free sessions. You can call again about an issue with a parent and get another set of sessions. Had a fight with your husband? Call and get another set of sessions. I have not found a limit to this yet. Remember, anyone in your household can use it as well. If your spouse is struggling, they can get free sessions. If you have a child that is struggling, they can get free sessions. 
The other resource that I have found very helpful is NAMI, National Alliance on Mental Illness. I just started to be familiar with this organization. Their website has a lot of really good information. In some areas, they have support groups for people with mental illness and for their families. They have a help line 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) that is available M-F 10AM-10PM. What I found most helpful is their text line, my breakdowns tend to be in the evenings or Sundays. They have trained crisis counselors that are available for free 24/7. All you have to do is text NAMI to 741741. It has been the extra support that I needed to be able to get to the next day. 
I hope no one needs it but I feel this is a case that there is not harm in repeating it and providing it to people who might already know it. If you would like to message me about any of this information feel free to message me.",TeacherReality
1645491280.0,Do the poor working conditions filter for a personality type?,"First of all, let me first say what a relief it is to find this sub. The working conditions in teaching are NOT normal or acceptable, and it's nice to find others who can say it openly.

Second of all, I'm going to be very direct and frank in the commentary I want to make. I'm sorry if I word things awkwardly, and if there's a better way to express something, I'd appreciate some correction from others here.

Third of all, I want to speak from my own experience teaching in higher education. I have not been a k-12 teacher, though my wife is in a private school. I've been a university lecturer and college adjunct professor in a few different contexts. 

The working conditions in US higher ed are laughably bad. I used to see comically over-the-top labor abuses within the University of California, and someone described to me (accurately, I think) working as a college adjunct as being ""basically an uber driver."" I got frustrated after 3 years of the nonsense, and took an entry-level job at a luxury hotel doing manual labor. I actually made more money there even though it was a minimum wage job I could've gotten in high school, but I digress.

BY FAR the most frustrating aspect of teaching in higher education was **the other people I worked with**. I would see (again) COMICALLY over-the-top labor abuses and bureaucratic dysfunction in, for example, the University of California, but the other people in my same precarious position would bend over backwards into their own assholes to defend the schools and programs, at times as if they were defending their own families. I knew for a fact that these other lecturers had no financial incentive, had no promise of more stable working conditions, and could sometimes be under even worse conditions than I was. And yet, they pushed back against any and all criticisms of the schools/curriculum, even outside of the school in our personal lives. 

When I took entry-level jobs in the private sector, I would see similar abuses and mismanagement. The major difference was that *the other people I was working with* would openly articulate, talk about, and acknowledge that wrong things were going on. They normally would NOT bend over to defend inappropriate management, or the money guzzlers at the top. It is honestly a breath of fresh air to speak to others who can state plainly what is right in front of our faces. 

I have no sympathy for the people who are in those shitty working conditions at the universities I worked in. These were the same people who would fight tooth and nail to the death to convince me that the schools NEEDED to treat us like garbage, and that's the way it has always been, and I need to change my attitude. 

But...where in the world does this obsequies sycophancy come from? I have this working theory that I'm hoping others can help me with. 

One of the jobs that I took after getting fed up with higher ed was as an enumerator with the 2020 US Census. My gig with the census may have the biggest shitshow I have ever been a part of, and it was truly an appropriate crescendo for the Trump administration to purposefully make it into a shitshow, as the president's 1 term in office was coming to an end. 

However, the best part of the job BY FAR was going on the r/Census subreddit and shit-talking the whole thing with other like-minded people. Others had even worse experiences in the Census than I had had, with stories about inappropriate supervisors, dangerous situations that the bureau refused to rectify, and (to top it all off) the failure of the federal department to issue W-2 forms once the thing was all over. 

Somewhere along the line, towards the end of Census operations in October, something changed on the subreddit. MASSIVE amounts of people quit their census jobs, and I can only guess that not long after they quit, they stopped participating in the census subreddit. That meant that by the end of operations, rational people had already been long filtered out, and only the goobers were left. I remember that I posted a thread about a negative personal experience I had while out in the field, and I would receive replies along the lines of, ""Well, that sounds like a you problem!"", or ""You need to act more professional as a Census enumerator!"" My posts earlier into census operations WOULD NOT have gotten such responses. 

Given that I love teaching, I'm really good at it (I've gotten nothing but top evaluations in university/college settings), and I feel like I work well with middle-school aged students, I've thought about pursuing a position as a middle school teacher in a public school. Of course, here in California I would need to pay $15k for the credential that would allow me to even apply to jobs, I hesitated, but what really turns me off is the thought of the absolute wieners I may need to work with. When it comes to teachers, I've seen many things: people with personality disorders, hormonal imbalances, abusers, or mood disorders who take out their mental illness on powerless teenage students, tenured teachers who teach their class by simply having students stare at a wall for 2 hours (I've mostly seen this one in math classes for some reason), and of course the English Language Arts idealists who wish they were Robin Williams's character in *The Dead Poet Society*. The idealists concern me the most, as I see them as working with fewer professional boundaries. 

Shit conditions create a toxic workplace, in which talented and caring teachers are filtered out and only the losers are left. 

I want to leave, but then I think...my own kids are going to need to be taught in these failing systems someday. They will need to suck up to the abusive teachers with mood disorders or hormonal imbalances, and their future will depend upon their ability to get subjectively awarded letter grades from people who are lucky to have found a position paying them $40k per year. 

Am I on to something here? US schools seem to be a work environment that demands conformity to loser behaviors...right?",TeacherReality

So yeah people not in the classroom and haven’t been in years doing cheers and lecturing us that we are the ones who determine the success and failure of the class. Really?!? I just spent the morning having a child destroy my room because he couldn’t play on YouTube and color with markers on the wall.

Last year I had a parent tell me they couldn’t have anyone over because the kid didn’t like it. I signed up to teach reading, writing, math, science.

1645133445.0,Question for Everyone (Especially Teachers) 🤔,"Hello Reddit world! This is my first ever post on any page of reddit, so I apologize in advance if I mess up the etiquette of posting, but please bear with me.

I have been worried lately about the troubling signs of the death of our public school system. Whether it's the conservative bills aimed at teachers curriculums, or the hateful rhetoric being thrown at teachers and their unions, I can't help but feel like America is on its way to privatizing the school system entirely, which terrifies me. I fear for the families that rely on public education for their children's schooling, and that would most likely be unable to afford a private education for their children. I'm also worried, that some of the loudest voices against teachers and public schools are also some of the people who would be impacted the most by the end of public schooling in America.

So, I wanted to ask the people and teachers here some questions. I will put them in a list below:
1.) Are you worried about the death of public schools in America?
2.) If public school ends, what do you think the new system will look like?
3.) Do you believe education will still be a requirement for families, one that is punishable by law if they choose not to have their children go to school/can't afford it?
4.) Do you believe education is a right? Or is it a privilege?
5.) How do you feel the end of public schools will affect the country (if it happens)?

Reddit admin has reinstated me as a moderator (I was the third moderator down before being removed by the previous top mod) as well as the other mods. Given the mess you see before you, you are probably wondering whether I am fit for this job (I know I am wondering the same thing). 

I want to assure you we are going to work to make this community better. We want a community that is inclusive of everyone who enters into it with good intentions. This was meant to be a sub that offered the public an understanding of the daily experience of teachers and guidance to teachers who, unfortunately, felt they could not continue in the profession. It was meant as a place to improve education, not disparage it or the professionals that put in the hard work every day to improve the lives of their students.

Teaching can be hard. I have been an educator for 16 years. I have attended my students' funerals. I have made the calls to CPS. I have been helpless to stop things I knew were wrong. That does not change my unwavering faith that the work we do is just and right. 

I want this work to be more sustainable. I'm tired of watching young teachers burn out. That is why we are here-- to offer care and support.

I have to finish my work day now (snow days aren't snow days anymore), but I hope you'll hang on as we restructure and bring this sub back to life. 

P.S. Mods should serve at the discretion of the community for benefit of the community. The hardest part of all of this for me was watching as someone who did not have the community's interest at heart acting like a petty tyrant. If you have concerns about the current moderation, please state them here. If it is necessary for me to step down, I will work to ensure first that competent, caring hands have control of moderation within the sub.",TeacherReality

If you are thinking of changing careers, but think you aren't qualified..... 

Teachers are belittled and taken advantage of to ensure we are kept in our place. We are constantly micromanaged so that we don’t think we are capable of other work or functioning and having success on our own in another workplace. This micromanagement/belittling is done to keep highly qualified teachers in the place where society needs us to be in order to take advantage of us. We are capable and qualified for many other things. Not to mention higher salaries. 

If you feel like you are unqualified for a job that you want, apply anyway. Most jobs in EdTech or tech startups are figuring it out as they go along. If you don’t understand the tech lingo, you are capable of adapting to the systems and the skills that you would need are learnable skills. 

Think of how much you had to learn on the job in a short amount of time in your first year of teaching. You are adaptable; sell that in your cover letter. You adapted to the pivot from in-person to online learning and you probably did it overnight; that makes you tech savvy. Be confident in yourself because you are worth more than you realize.

My class average is like a 33 and the only reason I let them slack off is because I cannot help that they were conditioned to not do any work, but the principal still expects that they pass for graduation rates to look good. 

So they will pass without deserving it.

Talk about sex, drugs, and drinking in front of me. Openly cuss with no regard to their environment.

I am shocked to say the least at what high school has become. I guess you really have to pick which hill you’ll die on but the standards have fallen so low for student conduct.

Covid really made last year irregular, so this year is much more “normal.” 
We have some interim admins and a new super. My 3 evals, last year went up consecutively. This year my veal numbers are heading in the wrong direction. I just had my second of the year today and it was bad.

Those who evaluated me last year seemed very caring and like they were genuinely interested in making sure I improved. This year it’s much different, as a non-tenured teacher I feel my job is always at risk. I do not want to feel like this for another two year.

My lesson was not perfect but I felt that it was harsh given the sample size and context of the lesson. I feel that both observations I’ve had this year the take away is, “I would have done this, so that’s what you should have done.” I never want to lose my individuality as a teacher. 

It seems to add what they want in every single one of my lessons getting through the curriculum is out of reach and would take hours more planning. Some nights as is I plan and make materials till 10 or 11 pm. I don’t know how much more I can mentally give. 

I am very passionate and love my students, perhaps it’s an obvious bias, but I feel like I am an effective teacher.  These observations and administrators are making me feel down on myself, worried about job security, and like maybe this isn’t for me.

I don't even know how it began. I was sitting at my desk getting attendance done; the kids were supposed to be writing some answers on a notecard. Then out of nowhere I hear C just blow up. I stand up and I see him sitting there, his face all read as he's telling F that he's tired of his shit.  He keeps repeating, ""I'm tired of your shit!"" He slams his iPad down on the desk and stands up. The whole time I'm trying to get them to stop yelling at each other, but they have no interest in me in the slightest. F stands up as well, posturing to fight. They're at the verbal threats phase when I make it to the phone and dial for assistance. 

I'm still working hard to de-escalate the situation and try to keep these kids from killing each other but they're completely deaf to anything I have to say. Our psychologist (whose room is across from mine) comes over, and so does my neighbor teacher - she left her class because she heard the commotion. Someone flips the lights on, the psychologist calls on her radio for assistance as well. They're trying to help de-escalate. Our campus monitor shows up and grabs F because it was getting close to swinging, and he has to drag the kid out of the room. After he's gone, C focuses on another student and says something to her, about how he's tired of her, as well. She's taken aback, but some of the kids are now laughing. 

They finally escort C out of the room too. The kids can't seem to stop talking about it. They're laughing, it's a huge fucking joke to them. I tell them it's not funny. One girl says, ""It lowkey kinda is."" I said no, it's not.

1643165747.0,Got undermined by a colleague today,"I teach 7th grade English and every Tuesday we meet as a PLC. One of the teachers asked the gifted teacher and ELA interventionist if she would write a 40 day plan for the unit but there was zero requirement that we all had to use it.

The interventionist asked one of my co workers in PLC today where she was at on the unit and my co worker respectfully said she was not following the unit calendar but was still teaching the same material. The gifted teacher began to blow up at her and got angry that my co worker was not using this plan because it ""fit the prociency scale perfectly"". She continued to lay into her for no good reason and then thankfully, the bell rang. 

Fast forward to the afternoon PLC meeting. My other co workers brought up the incident so I said that I think what we were trying to convey this morning is that her and I are trying to meet the students where they are at skills wise. The gifted teacher then proceeded to lay into me and YELLED at me because ""there's no difference between any of the students on other teams"". Except that... I teach the ELL, intervention, and iep kids. She was so rude to me and then the advanced English teacher jumped in and literally said this comment to me ""that's what teaching is, we break things down so that the kids can understand it"". All I was trying to explain to them was that I had started the unit plan last week from day 1 and decided today that I was going to go back and re teach claim, evidence, and reasoning. It really was the most unprofesisonal thing I have experienced.

I found out from my co teacher that one of the 8th grade teachers leaves PLC in tears whenever the gifted teacher attends their meetings. This is not an isolated incident. 

I felt so undermined in that moment as a professional. I was shaking when I went to my meeting with my instructional coach because I was about to cry. I explained to my coach what happened and we sat down to go over the proficiency scale. She told me I was right on target and to focus on students building a strong argumentative paragraph instead of a five paragraph essay.

This was a scary situation and I felt very alone. I would like to give some clarification of this incident as well as an update. Warning, it's still in progress but so far it hasn't been great. For context, I work with high schoolers in a rural town.

The situation was this: I was observing the lunchroom when he made a comment about someone's ass. I turned around and he said ""Why'd you turn around?"" In the moment I was very confused and it seemed like he had been speaking about me. As I stated, I informed my supervisor and principal. The next day the student found me while I was doing bus duty and he started yelling at me. When I informed the Principal, she later asked me if I would be willing to sit down and discuss it with him to ""take my power back"". We just had the meeting today...two weeks later.

The student alleged that they had been ""talking about their friend behind me"", and I just happened to turn around. I told him how bad it looked, and how he had no right talking to *anyone* that way. And that the reason why I had approached the principal about the situation was that if anyone looked at the incident from an outside perspective (adult and minor flirting), I could lose my job. I had to protect myself. I reiterated that his aggressive approach to me after the incident did not help his case either. He apologized for his behavior and for ""any unnecessary trauma he may have caused."" Whether he meant it or not is still up for debate...

I am currently in the process of trying to set up a meeting with HR to discuss how this was handled. How it felt like this was taken lightly, and not as serious as it could be. How I did not feel safe the, again, *two weeks* it took to set this meeting up. I asked for a male coworker to stand with me during bus duty just to feel slightly safer at my own job.

I also have informed my Union Rep, though technically I'm still in the process of having my application accepted. She is on my side and has been supporting me through all of this.

I'm sorry this isn't the big, badass update you all may have been wanting. But I'm still trying to find my footing in this. I promise I won't stop and let this slide.

I was talking to my wife about this exact topic last night and she said that a lot of teachers feel that way and that I wouldn't understand because I never have felt that way about a job and looking at these replies and thinking about it more I think she's right. 


I don't know if there's a way to word this without it coming off as maybe a little offensive but I am curious the thoughts of teachers on it.

I've been following the events of the last several years in regards to education. It seems like half the country just has a pretty anti-education stance at this point. They're banning books, parents are threatening teachers and administrators at board meetings, the kids seem to be out of control and not to give a shit largely... Cities don't properly fund schools so that teachers are expected to teach more and more kids each class to the point where it just seems impossible to do a good job. Schools are putting kids in debt for food... Also if you think of the salary that teachers get as a metric of how valued they are by society it's not good and honestly it's never been good. A huge and disproportionally powerful chunk of society just seems to be making it their personal mission to make the profession shittier.

My question is, why don't you just throw your hands up and go fuck it, fuck these kids and their stupid parents. The parents want to tell me how to teach, you teach your dumb kids then and they're going to grow up to be dumb fucks just like you, not my problem anymore. Do you feel trapped in the profession because it's what you went to school for? You're all smart people wouldn't a company want to hire you for something? Why not just quit and wash your hands of it all and just stop thinking about it. The country doesn't value education anymore and that seems to be getting worse so why not just give up on it?

I'm not a student or a parent and I never will be a parent so maybe that's why I have this attitude? I vote on increasing the budget and funding for schools whenever possible but I feel like people just don't value it, they don't want to pay for it. A lot of people say they support teachers but when it comes down to it I don't think they actually do, it's just lip service.",TeacherReality

1642700113.0,"Teachers punching kids, my controversial (?) take.","If you're not aware of it, there was a video posted a little while ago where a kid is being terrible, the teacher reaches a breaking point, and the teacher swings.

*Tldr at bottom*

Down near the bottom of that thread, you'll find my comments. Which I acknowledge were poorly phrased, and you'll see they got a lot of downvotes. I want to take a second to express myself better, and hopefully have a discussion, if people still disagree with me and want to downvote that's cool I'll eat it.

When we see a teacher taking a swing at a kid, and all we do is condemn the teacher or applaud the teacher, we're missing the chance for a good conversation. It should go without saying that it is almost never appropriate for an adult to hit a kid.

Just in case it's not clear, the teacher should not have hit the kid.

With that said, I don't think we can just condemn the teacher and walk away. We have to condemn the systemic failings that put the teacher in that situation in the first place. Because it's easy to judge from the other side of a keyboard. But every single person has a breaking point.

I am not a teacher right now, specifically because I knew it was not good for me to be somewhere where I was going to have to dance on that line.


**Back to the controversial thought.**

In America we have primary positions where we expect people to deal with the public as an authority. Teachers, and cops. I'm going to leave out my political opinions on cops, because I don't think it's worthwhile in this discussion, but I will simply say that de-escalation should play a much higher role, and violence a much smaller role, in policing.

Regardless, cops have a pretty big tool belt when it comes to carrying out their objectives, maintaining their authority, and trying to feel safe. Regardless of abuse, that's not the topic, there are a lot of tools.

What tools do teachers get? Ask nicely? Call the office and hope they come down?

And as a cop, you're not in a high stress situation from the moment you clock into the moment you clock out. Even on the worst beat, you've got a partner, you can go back and hang out in your car for a little bit, back up is always waiting to come. It's not you on the streets by yourself for 8 hours straight with pretty much no help.

You remind me of the horrors I used to hear in the teacher's lounge. Teachers saying horrible things about their students in their back. What the fuck was wrong with them? And with some of you?

Now I understand it probably was not a coincidence that I was the **only** teacher in the whole school that had a great relationship with the students, with my classes always being kind-of-quiet, never losing my composure... and that I was the only one who seemed to respect the students as actual people.

As the title states, I am a new teacher who is teaching English, and I never had the opportunity to student teach before the pandemic hit. Got a job across the state after finishing my master's in theater (English BA), and I was so excited to be pursuing my desired career and not living off unemployment looking for anything to survive.

Every day I am just wondering how a lesson or unit will go that I can create on my off time, since my planning periods are busy covering for teachers out from covid. Some days are great, and many other days the lessons don't work. That's fine, it's part of the growing pains right? That's what I want to believe...I want to believe I am doing the best I can with the hand I have been dealt, yet still feel like a joke of a teacher.

The kids overall are just disrespectful and nasty to me. I feel like I am failing them, yet I am trying so hard and learning as well. Even with how they treat me, I care about their education and want them all to be successful. Some are wonderful and enjoy the theatrical display I put on as I pretend I am not screaming internally and teach them what I can, yet it is exhausting. My mental health has plummeted. I dread going to work or having to talk with my students.

 I let teenagers get to me as they give me lip and don't pay attention or refuse to do work...and these are honors students. They view any new teacher as inferior and not worth their time. Even when they haven't been taught a good amount over the last few years, like writing a properly formatted essay...they just don't follow and refuse to believe I know what I am talking about...and when I don't give them As because they did it wrong or was written poorly? Parents come lashing out because I am a problem teacher. Their child never fails, so it's my fault they are. How dare I not give them an A like others do. The ones who don't even turn it in? Admin says give them a 50 at best. Don't give Fs otherwise. Never a 0.

I try my best to be patient with them and not lose my cool, because it's not professional or right to raise my voice in a mean way or return the nasty behavior. On the days where I can get students to follow along and learn, I feel a little better about myself...until the moment I make one tiny mistake, and I am jumped on. As for admin helping me with behavior? A slap on the wrist for that kid being rude and they are fine as they don't want to ""upset the parents"". 

I feel helpless. Does it get better? Did I pick the worst time to jump in as a new teacher during a pandemic? Or is this the reality and future of education in the US? Am I just bad at this job? I am just so unhappy and tearing myself apart mentally and it's affecting my life outside and my personal relationships. 

To all of the teachers who have had more years of experience and go through this; I absolutely respect you. I feel weak and mentally soft for feeling this way after only five months. I don't know how many of you are still doing this. The only reason why I feel motivated to even go to work is because I feel like I have no other way to get a job with a reasonable income. 

Should I just quit? I don't even know what jobs a new English teacher with minimal experience in education could do. I have mostly been a student before this. I just feel so lost and defeated and I feel terrible writing this. For those who have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my rant. I am already considering finding a therapist to help me out with my depressed state. I just need to know what routes to even consider. 



TL;DR: New English teacher with no prior experience, not even student teaching. I feel like a terrible teacher and the job and treatment from students and parents has left me in a dangerously depressive state. Looking for a way out to save my well being, or the advice to tough it out.",TeacherReality

1643106953.0,How to escape from Teaching to Tech: an easy guide,"##Why?

- High employment
- Huge salaries
- Really not so hard
- Often can work remote
- Your boss HAVE TO make you happy because you can just quit

##Which industry?

- Video games, software development, webdev...
- Webdev currently a very good choice, lots of demand, good work condition, high salaries. I only know webdev, so I will talk here about webdev.

##Is it easy?

Nothing worth doing is really easy. It is a LOT of work, because there are a **lot** of things to learn. It can be a very pleasant experience depending on your situation and interests, or it can be not for you at all.

This article will try to list everything that can help you or impede you. If you have a lot of positive points, you should definitely do it. If you don't, then maybe not.

##Which skills are needed?

- Passion for programming: huge advantage, but not mandatory.
- Ability to sit in front of a screen for long times (or stand, you WILL invest in a standing desk eventually)
- Talent: Some people learn faster than others. Some people start with an affinity for computer logic. You don't need talent to succeed, but talent will help you achieve your goals faster.

##Can anyone do it?

- Some people can't learn programming at a decent pace.
- Most people can succeed in a couple years.
- Some people can succeed in a very short time (6 months to a year)

Teachers are often bright people, so most of you should be in 2nd or even 3rd category.

ADHD/Autistic people usually succeed very well from what I've seen (conditions apply).

Note: these estimations are assuming you are in the ""unemployed"" category. If you work full-time on the side, it can be much longer.

##Personal advantages:

- You have a network of programmers around you (friends, family)
- Non-native English speakers: you speak English fluently

##Personal disadvantages:

- You have kids. It's already a lot of work, a lot of pressure, and a lot of interruptions while you study. Still possible, but it makes it harder.

##How to learn?

- Self-taught works: online MOOCs and courses.
- Paid bootcamps: Sometimes bad. Sometimes very expensive. Sometimes great. Need to check what they're teaching, ""real"" reviews from alumni, etc.
- 42 free coding school: In Paris and Silicon valley (maybe other places). I recommend it if you can get past the entrance exam. Don't need to finish the full 3-years, you can leave after one.

Other considerations: You need to work on Unix for most technologies, so either install Linux, or if you have too much money and you don't hate apple then buy a mac.

Additionally, you should balance your time between practicing and learning. Practicing should go first, until you're blocked, then it's time to learn. Once you know enough to unblock you, go back to practicing.

##What to learn?

Full guides here: [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/)
Frontend is a good choice for starters and a good entry to the job. You can also aim to enter as backend or fullstack, but you need some frontend knowledge anyway.

The guides are a good resource, but you should also check where you live/where you WANT to live and see what's the most sought after there.

##When to learn?

- While working on the side (so on evenings, weekends): Difficult, but might be doable. Might take a much longer time.
- Quitting your job to study: Much easier, but you need to be able to support yourself financially.

##Timeline for self-taught webdev

To learn a new technology, you usually start with lessons and short exercises (i.e on [websites like this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)). Then I would advise to build a decent-size project to really be sure you're past tutorial hell (see below). This project should take at least a couple week of full-time work.

Then keep learning highly researched new technologies. When you know ""enough"", start looking for a job. ""Enough"" might be HTML/CSS/Javascript + React + other stuff like Git (see guides).

While you're actively looking for a job, keep working on personal projects.

Finally, know that ""writing working code"" is not enough, you need to produce Enterprise-grade code. Read about ""Best practices"". Try to find a mentor to guide you on this vast topic.

##What are the biggest challenges?

- Tutorial hell: when you are able to do ""coding exercises"", very small projects, small web pages, but are unable to start a real project which scales in complexity. No easy solution for this except practice, practice, practice.

- First job: The first job is the hardest to get. The reason is that rookie developers actually cost more to a company than they bring, and once they start working efficiently they often leave for a better job. So companies have little incentive to hire you out fresh out of school.

Once you are past 2 years experience as a developer, [you are worth more than money](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/companies-worry-more-about-access-to-software-developers-than-capital.html) and will never be hungry again.

1697257011.0,My age is impacting my authority?,"Hello! I’m a 20yr old female dance teacher who is having trouble garnering respect from my students, fellow dancers, and some fellow teachers. For some context my fellow dancers are around high school age and my students range from 3-10yrs old. I also happen to default to saying “yes” when it comes to helping others in my free time, I am diagnosed with autism (the faculty are aware) and I have taught in a public school and in a ballet company. 

I believe that my age is impacting my authority because a parent of a student who was acting out in class said that I looked like a, “big sister” instead of a teacher. I have also been talked down to by the high school dancers because I am supposedly too old to be allowed to sit somewhere even if I got there first or I have seniority in the company. However, these same dancers would make way for other dancers my age with the same skills if they happen to guest for our company. I was also kinda forced to massage one of the senior eachers because I was not busy. They did not stop to ask if I was ok with it. 

I have been in therapy and am now learning that people can take advantage of you, but I want to develop authority at least equal to my position in the school. I have been working on declining things that I am not interested in doing, but I still have trouble with saying “no” in the moment. Is there any way to change my reputation at my school?

1695876265.0,Tonight I was scolded by a parent for telling their kid to quiet down.,"I am a high school music teacher who often takes students to events after school. Tonight we were on a bus and the students were very exuberant,  talking and laughing loudly.  One girl in particular had a very high pitched -ear piercing laugh which was bothering our bus driver who asked her to stop. The kids ignored the bus driver, so I stepped in calling the girl’s name and asked her to quiet down. (Loudly in order to be heard over the commotion)

As parents often come to these events, the parent s of the loud girl approached me very upset that I had yelled at their child in front of a bus full of students which embarrassed her. They also felt the need to explain to me that their daughter has a loud voice and I should understand that she can’t control it. 

So, I’m not supposed to control a situation where a child’s high pitched laugh is distracting a bus  driver in fear that I might embarrass the kid? How does this make sense?

I work for a Montessori school for preschoolers as an assistant and have been there for almost a year. We have a very high turnover rate for assistants cause we were always understaffed and people leave constantly. I’ve given my 2 week notice and was asked to stay one more week as we have some staff that are out for vacation. I ended up agreeing cause I felt bad and wanted to show how dedicated I am even if I’m leaving. Side note, I personally feel like the parents trust me more than the newer assistants since I’ve been there longer than then. So some parents I feel like are comfortable talking to me about their child’s day or progress. The other day I was called by my assistant director and director to the office, saying that a parent “complained” that I made their child seem like they are terrible or bad… and a couple days before I was talking to that same parent informing her that I’ll be leaving and of course she was saying that it’s sad for them to see me go. I also was telling her that I will miss working with her kid since her kid is in preschool and I was assigned for toddlers that week I am originally for preschool and hated that they’ve put me in toddlers since I’ve never worked with toddlers on top of that I told them that I would like to keep my 9-5 schedule and I have communicated to them long time ago that I prefer not to close but still they’ve put me on a closing shift. She made a sly comment saying “ugh I wouldn’t want to be in toddlers, I think I can be with infants” since I felt like we were in a joking kind of conversation I responded to her jokingly “don’t be fooled”(about the infants) apparently the same parent mentioned this to my director and was pretty much told by my director and asst. director to avoid parents at all costs and to shut up and just be very positive. side not our previous lead teacher called cps and licensing on this place. There are so much other dramas that went on but it’s too long to add here.Now I feel awful since all I just care about their child but don’t meant anything by it. But I dislike working at this place and I’m really unhappy which is why I’m leaving. I’m so traumatized after I was called into the office for this reason. I feel even worse that I’m on my last week and I feel so attacked. This place has caused me so much anxiety all throughout my stay. I guess my unhappiness is reflecting on the way I communicate?  I’m really sad about this whole thing and I feel like I cannot show my face to them anymore. Also cause I feel so betrayed and that they don’t have my back after all the crappy ways they’ve treated me. I don’t know what to feel and think anymore.

1690805488.0,Moving Around Before Exiting,"Where you teach, who you teach, who you teach with, what you teach, who your boss is all matter immensely. Some schools do an excellent job with mentoring and supporting new teachers. Some schools are best for veteran teachers on the verge of burnout. During my first few years, I hopped around a bit: I taught in a small CA Catholic middle school, a rural Virginia middle school, a small CA private secular K-8 school. Then I moved to NYC and I taught at a large Title 1 high school NYC closed down, a new small Title 1 grades 6-12 NYC public school (aftermath of the closing down) for 9 years. I then moved South and taught in Maryland at two charter schools, one located in DC. I then took a job at a very large (academically) high performing suburban Maryland high school. All have their strengths and weaknesses, upsides and downsides. If you are someone who craves meaning and seeing a relatively immediate positive impact on others as I do, I advise frustrated teachers to try a variety of settings and, if you can, and move when things get stale before giving up on the profession completely. Also, don't be afraid to switch subjects. I taught math at the private schools, got bored, and then got certified in English. Middle school kids were driving me crazy so I picked up an ESOL license through Praxis, allowing me to teach any grade. Later I did the same with social studies. This helped me get away from the massive amounts of grading. Happy now although I sometimes miss my colleagues and the family-like environment from the high pressure Title 1 schools. But times change and we need to change with the times.",TeacherReality

1690122208.0,I got a write up during the summer for having anxiety,"So, it seems I need a new way to share my vents, my frustrations, my joys just all of it.  So, let me give a little back story.  Last year at the end of the year we learned that we had 3 APs leaving, one being my evaluator and the other two being over scheduling along with our director of Special Education who I bonded with this year as a first-time small group teacher.  This mean that for the first time since I've been working at this school I left with no clue of what I might be teaching next year and absolutely no idea as to who I'll be working with in my direct chain of command.  

A friend of mine put up a post about all the changes he wants to make to improve himself and his school year this year.  I commented telling them I was anxious because of the information above.  That's when I learned a few things.  1) They have a teacher rat on their FB.  2) My fears about this principal which had been subsided after their being here for two years were actually founded. 3) Having anxiety is a negative reflection of the school and a violation of social media policy (WTF!!!!).

So, obviously someone had to tell the principal what I commented because per social media policy both our accounts are friends only and the principal isn't a friend on either account.  So, I get a call from the principal berating me for having anxiety about the year.  Accusing me of being ungrateful because they had fended off issues and defended me as a teacher last year (um as long as I'm not doing anything wrong isn't that their job?).  The icing on the cake though was their telling me that if I have anxiety, I should be going to a therapist to fix my problems not sharing them with coworkers because they can't be on any assistance to my mental health.",TeacherReality

Everyone is stressed, off sick, injured from pupil assault. Ya know. Normal. 

Workload has been ratcheted up constantly because the school appointed some middle leaders from the money they don't seem to have. They need to justify their position so they've been making paperwork exercises. 

Teachers. Classic teachers. Fucking teachers. 

Meeting starts. We are told we will be creating a 900/1000 word planning document every half term based off *planning that is already online*. Yes. So we're going to copy and paste the content into a document, add some word soup and promises of differentiation that will probably not happen. 

Teachers all nodding. The same teachers who complain about workload and understand there's no time for this. I'm looking around wondering if they've done the translation yet. It roughly translates to 

""hey fuckers, you know that holiday you get to try and rebuild your shattered mental health?... how about we take another day of it off you... because this pointless fucking document HAS to be on the system by 9am on the first day. Not for students. For us""

No one says anything. The cat flap in an elephant house effectiveness senior leaders grin mindlessly knowing more work is being done. That must be good right? Do they wonder how much more work can be ratcheted up? No. Because that would require an understanding of management beyond unrealistic ungrounded mindless aspirations based on falsity.

1686837821.0,Career Advice,"Hi All, 

I work for a large urban district. We are surrounded by smaller suburban districts that do pay significantly more money (with less education requirements for top salaries). Here’s the catch: my district pays significantly more from years 1-10, it’s only after that point where the suburban districts leave my district in their dust.

For example, with a master’s plus 60 credits (or three master’s degrees, or one doctorate), my district’s top base salary is $105k after ten years. A suburban district will pay a base of $125k after 15 years with only a master’s plus 30 credits.

My salary is increasing by $6k starting this summer, but if I went to this suburban district at the equivalent salary step, my income would basically be the same as it was this year. 

So what would you do? Take a pay cut for a decade to reap the higher salary for the second half of your career, or decrease your total career’s earnings by about $300k and stay in the current district?

Thanks!",TeacherReality
1686712632.0,Blackout protest,"So... Elephant in the room: Why hasn't
r/TeacherReality joined the Reddit protest when so many adjacent subs have? The mod team hasn't spoken about it, so this is just me talking. But there is stuff worth saying.

First and foremost reason, in my mind, is that the community has not called for it. The first meta thread about the protest on the sub was posted today. If/when the community calls for action, the community will decide and we moderators will follow. What ""decided"" looks like in a site filled with bots and alts is a bit hard to nail down, but the decision rests with the community, not its moderators.

Second, I mod a few subs, one of which has joined the protests (the others are too small for it to be much impact either way). I would say that the purpose of *that* sub is entertainment, which is not the reason *this* sub exists. 

Our primary purpose is to offer a place for teachers to receive support in the tough choice many make to leave the profession. Summer is the time when many make that choice. When someone leaves their school, they may be leaving their support system, their friends, and reevaluating much about their life. This is a place to remind them that they still have value (both economic and *human* value). I don't want to shut down that life line just when someone might need it.

I've been teaching for 19 years-- I'm going to keep teaching-- but I've seen too many colleagues and friends broken, by what was the toughest choice they ever faced, for me to pull the rug out from under anyone who needs the help-- even for a moment. There are school admins, HR departments, and even colleagues out there who will make people feel like their humanity and wellbeing is a small price to pay for test scores-- we are a counter narrative to that.

Does that excuse anything Reddit is doing? No. I am personally horrified, especially by the shutdown of apps that provide accessibility where Reddit does not. 

If the sub decided that it was time to go dark, would I press the button? Sure. 

Is that my decision to make? I don't think so.

He LOVES confrontation (meaning, get an angry parent to calm down), coaches several sports and the students love him. He is the first one in the school and the last one out. This man is so dedicated, a great leader, teacher and colleague. 

Our school has two campuses. The other one is a huge mess and all the middle school teachers threaten to walk out. My principal was asked to intervene and help for a few weeks. And I guess their principal is now gone. 

HR decided to move him to that campus. I am pretty sure he is not happy about that. I know he loves his school and he complained about the other campus a lot. They didn't give him a choice.

We had a standing meeting last Monday to learn that over the weekend one of our students parents called the police because he found a pistol and AR in the kids bedroom. Upon further investigation admin found out there was a TikTok of this kid showing his buddy the guns in the school bathroom the week before. The day this kid brought them to school he was supposed within the first 32 minutes for flipping off a teacher. Based on his history we believe he intended to use them.

What did admin do? Sent out communication to parents 3 days after telling staff about it but said ""weapon"" even though we clearly knew it was a gun. Also, this situation could have been completely avoided because the kid sold pot gummies on campus the second week of school. He should have been charged with a felony and expelled then. No, we let him stay and be spent 27% of his year causing enough issues to be suspended. The kid that took the video in the bathroom for him? I found his TikTok and he's also a little prick. He thinks he's so tough and cool, his parents also bought him a shotgun for his birthday. Yet another kid that should've been expelled long ago for constant suspensions.

We have 1.5 days left and I feel like every day I go home I'm just thankful to still be alive. This whole event sends the message of: ""we don't care about your safety as long as these kids learn"". I signed a contract in a new district for next year and cannot wait to be out.",TeacherReality

How can you use positive reinforcement on a child who is received many warnings about being mindful about their body and surroundings but still constantly get hurt.  It has been going for 3 weeks.

I got so frustrated that I let the child know that I am scared to take them on summer field trips. If there is a 4th week I will put my foot down and ask one of their parents to go with. But ik for a fact they won't bother to come. They NEVER have.

ANYWAYS

No shock today and with my luck they went home and had a limp but didn't tell staff. And I get a message from mom along with my much now regretted statement of "" I'm scared to take them on field trips."" (Let mom know it was regrettably mentioned)

 I've already noted and know that they get overly excited before the transition to outside or new activites. I ask them to walk to the ""calm couch"" and to show me what relaxed and clam means. (If they are not running they are stomping and angry/screams because I am asking them to relax & calm down and even then the success rate is maybe 65%)
But this morning and my luck, they run to the couch and adds in a head into the wall. 

How do you turn running into the wall a positive reinforcement situation even after many warnings and told what behavior is to be expected? (*** please walk to the calm couch and relax) I've done my part to see what triggers cause these actions but its following through directions and listening isn't going though. 

Maybe I say and do ""I see that you ran into the wall, that's why the direction was to walk. Here is a hug,ice pack and an hour me panic observing to make sure you don't have a concussion"" 

Where do I add the ""rewarding or reinforcing desirable behavior in order to increase the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated in the future""?(google)

SO 

In my response, I told her ""How does after a couple of reminders to *** about being mindful of how our surroundings can affect our body or the choices that we make can affect our body. We can have *** sit next to a teacher for a calm break until *** is ready to try again."" 
 But it's still the same strategy I have used just different places and clearly it's not positive enough. Obviously reminders only can go so far.

Yesterday, my district received mass threats to middle schools throughout the district. Parents were advised to speak with their children and student absences were all excused. Here’s where i’m fucking pissed:

We, as their teachers, were not given ANY information. We were not told which schools received a threat (it’s a big district) and we were not told exactly what the threat entailed. We were also NOT encouraged to stay home like students were. they didn’t acknowledge us at all, actually. I was literally sobbing this morning on my way to work because I was so terrified. I said goodbye to my husband, my cats, my best friend and parents, hell I even drafted a goodbye note for my best friend to give my husband “just in case”!!!

Maybe it was stupid of me to not call out immediately, but we live in such a society where I feel BAD for wanting to protect MY OWN LIFE over the lives of other peoples kids that I have no relation to. Don’t get me wrong, I adore my students but I JUST got married. I JUST turned 25 (literally yesterday, got the email at my literal birthday dinner so that was fun /s) I have had unrelated health issues recently that has caused me to miss multiple days so close to the end of this school year and i felt bad calling out when I “didn’t need to” 

My roommate woke up to see me walking out the door sobbing my eyes out and so I told them what was going on and why I was still going in. How I didn’t know which schools were under threat and it was a small chance it was my school since the district was so big so “it will probably be fine” They told me to text my principal and ask if she had more info (this hadn’t even occurred to me, idk why) and she responded that it was in fact our school that was directly under threat. I told her immediately that I was staying home which thankfully she understood and wasn’t upset at all. 

It just PISSED me off that we as teachers got NO INFORMATION. There was nothing communicated that we were under investigation or called out. I had to ASK. Why didn’t they just close the school down?!? I spent the entire day stressed out of my mind and looking at the news every hour to see if there were any updates. We ended up getting a district wide email saying that the poster was arrested and would be charged accordingly, and thank fucking god that nothing happened but what the hell has america come to?! I shouldn’t have to go to work teaching CHILDREN afraid for my fucking life and saying goodbye to my husband and family! I’m beyond pissed off.",TeacherReality

1677549397.0,"Here's My Experience: I have no one to tell, so I'll tell you.","I need to express what I'm going through somewhere, and this seems like an okay place to do it. I often see people posting here in a rather negative way about students, but to be honest I don't find the students to be what makes this a punishing job. I became a teacher through TFA, so I have only worked in Title I schools. Fights break out, property gets damaged, and students can be generally noisy, mean, and way less mature than society expects, but I find that the way I treat students has a huge influence on how they respond to me. I have noticed at the schools I have worked at that the teachers most likely to complain about how horrible students are happen to be teachers that are mean and sometimes say dehumanizing things to students. They also happen to be teachers who are pretty ""old school"", and don't feel like its worth their time to bother keeping up with best practices in the field.

In short, I'm pretty new at this but student behavior is not something I prioritize as a problem. It may be that I came into teaching as what TFA calls a ""career changer"", and I am bringing my previous experience with me, which has happened to be pretty helpful in the classroom.

What makes this job such a demoralizing and demeaning experience is the school district... well, the system in general. There is just too much about how education works that honestly just seems like a stupid idea. What feels good to say is that the district seems like it's run by idiots.

When I started writing this post, I expected that I would be able to explain some of why I believe this. But now I'm running out of time to write, and I don't even know where to start because it's so overwhelming. I have worked in about two dozen organizations and I have never seen anything approach the level of incompetence and dysfunction that I am observing in this school district, full of people none-the-wiser going about their business as if this stuff was normal.

There are lots of valid criticisms about Teach For America, but one thing that they seem to do well is to expose incoming teachers to the most current practices in teaching, and give you a pretty formidable crash course on theory. One would think that a summer crash course on literacy education and pedagogy is but a humble beginning compared to the experience of education leaders who have a decade or more under the belt. This is what I believed. 

I shit you not, I have come to the slow awareness over my time teaching that the TFA crash course plus my previous work experience and unrelated degree have left me more prepared to do this right off the bat than a lot of people seem like they are after years. I do not feel proud of myself and am not bragging about this. Rather, it's the story of a slow horror that has been making itself known to me. Like, really? How is it that I have a better idea of how to do this than the people whose jobs are allegedly to tell me how to teach?

I have educators in my life that are inspiring, and I admire some public leaders in education as well. Of all the people who have a say over what I am doing (there are about seven *seven* ***SEVEN PEOPLE*** observing my classroom and leaving orders for me---no wait... EIGHT) one. *one.* **ONE OF THEM** is a person who obviously has good leadership skills, builds relationships with students and teachers skillfully, is extremely knowledgeable about teaching practices AND gives amazing feedback. ONE OF THEM, and it's the one that gets bulldozed the most by the others because this person is at the bottom of their hierarchy.

Could be worse. I trust my administrators' intentions and I like them. I've been disappointed by some of their decisions---I don't know what makes them think that asking me to explain my lessons over and over is a more helpful use of time than letting me reflect and come to our coach for feedback (coach with specific and recent experience in my subject area, or admin without experience in this core subject... which is more helpful?), or what makes them think that scolding me (""you better do it!"") is a good way to get the results they want from me when I am a grown-ass adult who is clearly intrinsically motivated to grow in this role. Actually, does anyone really need to be harassed into doing this job? Is it even possible? Who is even left teaching besides people who are stuck waiting for retirement and people who have some good personal reasons to even try it? I think that when they feel harassed and infantilized by their bosses, they decide to just pass it on.

As far as admin are concerned, that job is absurdly hard and overwhelming, but administrators who don't learn to fully trust the people who are working under their authority are just going to make it harder for themselves. That's true in every organization. 

Why my administrators feel that way is because they themselves have to report to a micromanaging hierarchy of people who maybe aren't people's favorite to work with. One would imagine that being a psychopath and sadist is a prerequisite for work in that department. There are so many cooks in the kitchen... I mean, we could totally better use that money to hire coaches and ESE teachers, but my district instead decided to create an out-of-touch, pompous hierarchy. Instead of sending work down the hierarchy, there are FOUR levels of this hierarchy that directly engage with us at the classroom level. They don't say anything---they mostly seem to try to avoid interacting with teachers. But they have opinions. And this entire organization is run according to their opinions. Not policy, not a concrete and transparent set of criteria... just their often inconsistent opinions. So we are left scrambling at the bottom to meet their often different expectations, which are sometimes incompatible with each other.

Their opinions are the worst. They insist that we adopt these awfully lazy teaching practices that they think are good teaching. They think they are rigorous. Putting their ideas to work in my classroom only makes things worse. I did it because I was sure I'd collect data on how it's worse, and I do have some. But now no one is interested in looking at my data. lol.

I teach students in historically poor neighborhoods. The overwhelming majority are from recently immigrated families or African-American families. I have students that have extremely poor self-management skills, short attention spans, and I imagine are neurologically under-stimulated and under-developed. For these students, a lot of scaffolding is important. I cannot simply put a grade-level text and a bunch of multiple choice questions in front of them and hope for the best, or ask them to read independently and shrug if they fall behind. That only works if they value education and are intrinsically motivated themselves. If they don't... well god forbid they appear to have fun in class, or that I spend a necessary amount of time getting them to buy into what I'm teaching so that it actually sticks, or that I give them a little agency so that they are treated like human beings for a while and practice making decisions about their learning. This is exactly what all the relevant experts and sources that I trust say I need to do, but the bureaucracy of child-hating psychopaths is not into it. They have the fewest complaints when what I'm doing looks like test-prep, which let's be honest bores the shit out of me and you, so definitely bores the shit out of my struggling students.

Not all my students are far below grade level. Some of them are at or above grade level. At some of the more highly-regarded schools in my district, their mastery would probably be seen as mediocre. However, relative to other students at my school, these guys are doing their best to aim high. In this group of students, I have students who have unbelievably bad situations at home and have to struggle with difficult family conflicts. They are emotionally affected by these things. Some of them struggle to be motivated. They might be the first English-speaking generation in their family. There are so many students that are driven and gifted. They go through the year barely turning any work in, and then BOOM they turn in something that demonstrates an impressive level of insight and creativity, maybe because they happened to have a good week and were better able to rise to their potential. They would soar so high if we only took notice and helped them overcome the obstacles that are holding them back.

Being responsive to the needs of either of these groups of students, which both make up the majority of my students, is not an important part of teaching according to the useless wastes of public money that have the most influence over what happens to them. When I try to do something to be responsive to my students according to best practices that I can cite, I tend to get reprimanded, called ""outside of the box"" for playing it safe according to science, get called ""rogue"" for letting my relationship with my students and all the data I get from that inform my teaching.

I have never felt as disrespected, demeaned, demoralized as a professional. I have never worked for people so ignorant. Their incessant demands for compliance with their unclear and contradicting instructions (how do you comply successfully with something that contradicts itself, anyway?) are oppressive and just wrong. They are so short on teachers, but I don't think they got the memo on that because they treat us like we are expendable. I already have another career and I am testing the waters through a TFA commitment... why the hell would I want to actually continue working under these conditions? 

If someone paid me to organize AGAINST this bureaucracy of clowns and identify them as the enemy of the people that they are I would take that job.",TeacherReality

1676670729.0,I made my VP cry today,"TLDR: I brought an error to the VPs attention and she responded by not fixing it and crying. 


In my district to handle sub/teacher shortages, teachers cover for absent teachers during their prep periods. We are supposed to have a union negotiated equitable rotation of teachers covering. My school in particular is terrible at it. People on the “leadership” team (deans, counselors, coaches, the vice principal and the principal) and school darlings rarely if ever are covering. 

Recently I complained that the space I’m reaching out of (I am a special education teacher, the only one in my building without their own class room) is being misused and it has become super disruptive to my students.

Since then, I have been covering almost every day and had three prep periods I wasn’t covering during in the past two weeks. 

Yesterday morning when I saw I was covering again, I asked the VP (who as part of her duties is supposed to create these schedules) why I had another coverage as it doesn’t make sense given the rotation. She responded that because of call outs EVERYONE was being used. Looking at the coverage sheet, this was obviously untrue but I let it go because I had stuff to do and I’m not interested in arguing with her.

Today, I sat in my car waiting for the daily coverage schedule to come in through email before going in. When I got it and saw I had lost my prep period again, I checked and made sure there were other people on the same rotation as me available. I already knew from checking yesterday that they should have been ahead of me in the rotation. None of them were covering, none of them had scheduling conflicts. There was no obvious reason it should have been me again. 

So armed with all this, I walked into the building and attempted to talk to my vice principal. I am NOT a confrontational person, and honestly part of why I’m dealing with not having a classroom and being used for coverages so much is because I am a very easy going person at work(I’ve learned my lesson now though). 

So I calmly tell my vice principal “VP, I covered 2nd grade Tuesday, 8th grade yesterday and you have me on the schedule for Kindergarten today. There are other sped teachers who have not had coverages at all this week.” (I had the ok to mention this from these teachers because everyone is aware of this issue and I’ve had all their backs before) 

And my vice principal starts crying and says “I’m sick and I’m here! And principal has said she will pay someone else to make the coverage schedule because I don’t want to do it anymore!” 

She wasn’t yelling but was loud, everyone is looking at us, I didn’t want to lose my shit so I just turned around and walked out of the office. I heard she starting crying more after I left and said “all the sped teachers hate me”

The absolute insanity of this situation is too much. Imagine someone bringing an error you made to your attention and responding by crying and telling them your job is too hard? I still lost my prep. She hasn’t said anything to me since. I’ve interacted with the principal since then and other leadership people who were there and everything was fine.

Idk what I want to do from here. I did talk to my union rep about it, they said they would address it but i am seriously just mind blown by the whole situation.",TeacherReality

Yes, asking about tattoos didn't occur to me as I never had to cover them before, my parents are teachers and covered in tattoo, it didn't even cross my mind. I also had a 1h phone chat with HR prior to my hiring and we talked, again, about teacher dress code extensively, tattoos were still not brought up. I feel deceited. 

I just started a new position as an ELA teacher in a charter (secular) middle school. The position has been vacant for nearly 2 years. I am highly qualified and they absolutely love me, they were desperate to hire me and paid my buyout for leaving my previous school.

Today a colleague, who also has a lot of tattoos, told, very nicely, me to cover up my arm tattoo, that it was against school policy.

I was told about dress code, which is slightly stricter than what I am used to, but I have no issues with it. I talked to HR for weeks (it was hard to break my old contract) never the tattoos were mentioned, and I have tattoos on my fingers! Idk if they were completely oblivious to them...

Should I pretend I don't know the rule? Also if I am told to cover them, which is ridiculous, none of my tattoos are offensive, the finger ones are a moon and a sun, the arm one is our local skyline, and the ones that will become visible in the summer are flowers, should I really cover them?

I live in Southern AZ and in August it can be over 115 degrees, I absolutely cannot teach in long sleeves!! And I will probably start coaching soccer, outdoors. 

What are they going to do? Fire a good teacher they had trouble finding and leave the classroom empty until they find replacement again? I'm the only ELA teacher of the entire school.

This is 2023 I don't know a single person my age who is not tattooed, it's absolutely ridiculous.",TeacherReality

Everything in her life was going well— she had a boyfriend who she communicated with very often. Donna Barber’s boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, was an inmate at the local prison. 

Donna Barber and her boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, would often video chat. By the way——-their video chats were steamy. On some occasions, Donna Barber would remove her clothes and participate in explicit conversations while on the job.

Once again, Donna Barber worked in a school with children. I’m not quite sure about the specific age or grade level. However, the inappropriate acts and verbal exchange in the workplace is off limits especially a school setting. 

Since, Lawrence Ray was an inmate he was breaking the rules, too. There’s strict rules that he disobeyed during their frequent calls.

Also, Donna Barber’s actions weren’t criminal as mentioned by the local state attorney. But….. the Franklin County School District began to investigate where her calls took place and the timing which were during school sessions.

According to the online records, Donna Barber was told that the school board would recommend termination. Since, her video chats were leaked to the public-she swiftly resigned. She nearly had a great retirement with pension and full benefits.

1674585850.0,Vent RE reference,"Just have to quickly vent that the first AP I emailed about writing me a reference turned me down. I was an ESL teacher at several inner city Title 1 schools for 3 years. I had to leave over a year ago when my parents were both facing life -threatening health problems, multiple heart attacks and Covid. (I had requested unpaid leave, 4 times, FMLA and board approved, but our system was so overwhelmed that nothing was ever processed, so eventually I had no choice but to resign.)

The nature of being a floater doing pull-out at multiple schools means no one is in a great position to write you a reference.

However, the AP in question was the most recent to observe me and gave me a satisfactory review.

I also spent many extra hours per day at the start of the pandemic helping her contact all families about devices and WiFi hotspots and update complex excel charts for her supervisors and so on. Unpaid, of course, just an extra admin duty I agreed to help with.

I just can’t believe that after all the blood, sweat, and tears I put into that job, plus spending hundreds if not thousands of my own money in supplies, that she can’t cough up a generic reference!

I loved the kids, but I’m regretting ever going above and beyond at that job. It nearly destroyed my health. So glad to be free.., but I need references to get back into teaching, and it would be nice if my admin would step up just a bit!

Anyone else in this boat??

1674102926.0,A student stole $40 from me 6 weeks ago. Shouldn’t the school reimburse me?,"It’s not even a question that he stole it. I had three twenties folded together in my pocket, and when I took my keys out, they dropped on the floor. As I was bending over to pick them up, the student I was talking to (14) bent over to pick them up first. I thought, “That’s awfully nice of him, picking up something for a man in his 50s!” But, no. He goes, “Finder’s keepers!” then walked out into the hall. 

I said, “Ha, ha. Very funny. Please give me back my money,” but he only handed me $20. I said, “What about the other $40?” He said there wasn’t any more, then turned around and put the $40 in his underwear. Because he had gone into the hall, we got very clear security footage of him doing that, so the dean, my boss and I got his mom on speaker and we all pleaded with him to hand it over. He refused. After about 10 minutes, I went back to class because I had work to do. As I was leaving, my boss said, “Sorry that happened to you.”

They suspended him for the remaining two hours of the day, but he refused to leave, meaning he got to spend the day in the building without going to class, which is what he does all the time, anyway. So, essentially he faced no consequence. During that time, he admitted to the dean that he stole it but couldn’t give it back because he “lost” it.

At his re-entry meeting, we again tried and failed to get my money back. He says his mom told him she would have done the same thing which I totally believe because I never even got an apology from her, much less the money her kid stole. The dean has been advocating for me to get reimbursed but gotten nowhere. I also asked the principal and didn’t even get a response. 

So, I put in my two weeks. I don’t have another job lined up and probably won’t go back into education, but fuck that. Seventeen years experience as a special ed teacher, an MA, and certifications in ELA and Social Studies / History, but they’re willing to throw that away for $40. I guess a job requirement for teaching now is a willingness to be robbed? I also just can’t teach this child any more because every time he wants something from me, all I can think is, “Oh, you want a pencil? Use the $40 you stole from me to buy a whole box.”",TeacherReality
1674060069.0,Teacher shortages prompt Bridgeport to consider moving students from Wilbur Cross to Thomas Hooker,"Cross needs 5 teachers, including a K Sped teacher and Resource Room, and the parents are livid.

Unfortunately, the district doesn't provide Sped teachers access to their online curriculum, and tell them to 'develop their own'. They also ignore IEP's and refuse to provide paras, which when they exist are paid $25,000. 

This, of course would be possible if $ was spent on lots of Teacherpayteacher worksheets, or if the teachers were professors at top schools with lots of money and help from interns. When I tweeted to the superintendent that he should rethink this issue, I was blocked from his official account.

1673817358.0,feeling horribly guilty for leaving my current school for another one,"I'm currently working for an alternative high school for at risk students. I want to leave because of ridiculous expectations from the corporates and the lack of community/spirit (I like most of my colleagues, but they are definitely not my friends and some colleagues really do make my days difficult). I am underpaid for my qualifications, our health plan is a patchwork of ridiculous plans that no doctor ever understands so I spend ALL of my lunch breaks on the phone with various providers to try to get simple doctor's visits covered. I have no retirement plan and I just arrived to the US with no saving and no plan for retirement. I keep getting undermined by corporates, colleagues can't put on their left sock on without me despite their seniority in the school (I've only been with them for a year and a half), more and more busy work with no real goal or growth out of them. Because of low enrollment I am incredibly bored. We also only have winter break, no fall or spring break. They often give holidays to the kids but make us come to school all day to ""plan"". No team building, we don't even have a break room, just. Meeting room with no window that happens to have a fridge and microwave. I spend my lunch breaks in my car!

So I have so many reasons to leave. But I feel so guilty, and I'll miss my students so much, because I do really love my students, they are the best part of the job. I feel guilty I am leaving a school that currently can't function without me. But at the same time I'm going to a school that needs me even more!

The new school has teachers my own age, happy students, spirit and community. It has a retirement plan and a real health insurance to offer as well as gas stipends, and more pay. AND I'll be able to put my daughter in pre-k there which will save me at least 10k!!!!! My days will be shorter. At the moment I only get 20min a day with my daughter, in the new school I would get an entire afternoon with her nearly everyday. And I can tutor for $25/h whenever I want which is really nice and I would still be home earlier than I am now.

So many reasons to be happy, and leave my current school behind. But the amount of backlash I am about the receive when I announce my departure, I'm also not giving notice as I am in an at will state and the school will withhold my last paycheck according to my contract (f them I'm not going to work for free!) so I will literally be gone overnight. And the disappointment of my students who are fragile teenagers who look up to me and who I absolutely adore... Urgh

In my decade of education I have had students who have experienced essentially every type of trauma you can imagine. 1 of my elementary students was murdered by his mother’s boyfriend. A 9 year old committed suicide. And another drowned in his bathtub after being drugged by his mother and then left unattended. 

I was hospitalized twice for injuries inflicted on me by students. I was told by my principal that getting a concussion from being head butted by a student was a REASONABLE EXPECTATION of my job. 

I had a complete mental breakdown a few months ago. I went through a severe bout with anxiety and depression and had to choose between my well-being or this job.

And here’s the kicker- I gave this job everything I had until I completely fell apart. When I had to resign because my physical and mental health were at serious risk, my principal didn’t even bother to respond to my resignation and just sent out an email to the staff about the logistics of covering my caseload. We are all completely indispensable. 

I honestly can’t believe I got out. A huge weight has been lifted, and this is the happiest I’ve been in years. I’m back to being myself. I’m back to being fun and happy.

1673367862.0,How to maintain order in my classroom when there's no support from admin?,"I'll be honest, guys.  I'm trying to leave this profession as quickly as possible.  I'm miserable.  My (middle) school is in complete disarray after a series of scandals, firings, quittings, and restructuring.  I won't get into it all here, but the result is that we're overcrowded, understaffed, dealing with an inexperienced new admin staff who create insane policies, and pure chaos from the students: daily fights, drugs, sex acts, etc. In the meantime, until I can make the switch, I'm just trying to survive.

The two biggest problems are lack of motivation/work completion and behaviors.  The first problem can be traced to a lot of things like COVID and lower standards, but perhaps the greatest cause is our school-wide policy of having to accept late work with no penalty until the end of the quarter.  I just had a student, who for the past quarter has screwed around and turned in nothing, email me a list of 10 assignments she completed, which I am forced to accept, and her grade went from a D- to a B+.  This leads to my nearly 200 students all being able to treat the entire school day as free time, then put in maybe 4 hours of effort at the end of the quarter and pass.

The second problem is bolstered by the first as well as other factors, but the result is that our admin is so overwhelmed dealing with high profile incidents, that absolutely nothing happens when a student has a minor infraction.  Dress code, talking over the teacher, food, cell phones, and games in class.  I could spend my entire day writing referrals (we don't have the authority as teachers to administer any other consequence such as a detention), but most of these referrals are ignored by admin or result in a quick 2-minute office lecture and then back to class.  Those who return to class stride in triumphantly and are admired by their peers.  Students show each other their behavior logs as a badge of honor.

What I'm left with is 6 periods a day, each over 30 students, who ignore everything I say, talk non-stop, get up and move around the room at will, sitting wherever they want, texting, throwing things, hitting each other, screaming, and me, trying hard to pretend that anyone is listening to me talk about metamorphic rocks.  Verbal warnings do nothing. Yelling does nothing. Writing kids up only encourages them.  When a parent finally concerns themselves with a student's grade, I get an email from said student listing all the assignments I should have forgotten about month's ago that I now have to spend time searching for online and grade.

What can I do to weather this storm until I can get out?  Is there any hope of having an effective seating chart and keeping kids in their assigned seats? Once again, I've spent hours upon hours writing behavior logs and referrals and speaking to admin about the problems with no success.  What can I do on my own, when there are no policies in place to support me, so that I don't feel like a prison guard who's just trying keep students' hands off each other and maintain my sanity.

I have a newish student who has been with me for a month. He is in my “reminder” category; he’s never had an accident and he will go, if needed, when I ask. 

Our sessions are 3 hours long, and I do “potty time” during centers, which is about halfway through our session. 

I asked this student if he needed to use the bathroom, and he said, “no.” Okay. 

30 minutes later, we do our second circle. He was dry at this time. 
Second circle is 20 minutes long, and parents pick up at the end. 

His mom was 10 minutes late. A few minutes later, she violently knocks on my door. When I opened it, she yelled at me because he was “soaking wet.” I told he that he was dry when circle started, and she asked how long ago that was (at this time, 30 minutes). 

Then she yelled that if it ever happens again, he won’t be coming back, and stomped away. 

I went back in and noticed a wet spot on the circle carpet.

Over the the last two years 16 people have either quit or transferred. Her and I got into a disagreement a few weeks ago due to the way she spoke to me in front of some kids and since then she has not liked me. Anyway, I was hired to be an EA in a resource room, due to the obvious nature of the job, before and during my interview (and several times after) I disclosed how I do not feel comfortable working with children who have some form of autistic spectrum disorder, of course it has nothing to do with a prejudice of any kind, just knowing myself I do not work well with individuals such as that. I was told it wouldn’t be a problem and my place in the resource room would center around some of the kids who struggle behaviorally. Well there is a child with autism who is on the case load and he requires an aid with him, the aid he originally had continuously called off and administration would have me to be his one-on-one aid. I reminded them of my disclosure but helped anyway because I am a team player. Two weeks ago they fired his aid and I agreed to help until the board could approve a new hire to take over. Last week they told the intervention specialist they were changing the way her room was ran, hiring a new EA to help her and changed my schedule to be his full time aid without talking to me at all.

Educators will be holding rallies on Saturday, first at 1 p.m. at Haverhill City Hall and then at 4 p.m. at Malden City Hall.

The HEA and MEA released the following joint statement:

“It is no coincidence that the educators in both Haverhill and Malden took votes today to authorize strikes if their respective contracts are not settled before Monday. Several unions representing thousands of educators in communities north of Boston meet regularly to discuss our working conditions, which are our students’ learning conditions. The educators in Haverhill and Malden have been working without contracts. The respective unions have made numerous proposals to address staffing shortages, racial and social justice, safety in schools, adequate time for educators to prepare and collaborate, and wages that have been chronically suppressed. The school committees in both communities are showing no interest in addressing needs we see as critical to our students’ success.

“We are saying enough is enough. Our students deserve better, our communities deserve better, and we deserve better.

“We acknowledge the disruption our strikes can cause. But we can no longer in good conscience see our students receive less than they deserve and for educators to be continually disrespected as professionals. We are ready to bargain any time to settle these contracts. Our respective school committees have the power and authority to avert these actions.”",TeacherReality
1665643908.0,Needing some advice and a rant,"Hi guys. Discovering this subreddit has been therapeutic.

I’m a first year ECT and 5 weeks in I already feel like I’m sinking. The school I’m at has a very intensive marking policy. All books marked and an assessment competed, marked and feedback given every three weeks (so twice a half term). Ive got 10 class groups so you can do the maths here…I’ve been staying up until 11 o clock two or three weeknights every week trying to get through it and I’m already not staying ahead. I got quite sick last week, and although the change of weather of course played a part I also think it was spurred on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. 

Yesterday I got pulled in by a member of SLT as a complaint that I hadn’t marked one of my student’s books. I had already marked that class’s books but the student but have been absent when I took them up. Half way through the conversation I felt like I couldn’t even hear what they were saying to me and I had a really strong urge to just leave the building.

I feel like I’ve already checked out mentally and I don’t want to stay in this job. I know it’s really bad to leave a teaching position mid year, but I truly think I could see myself having a breakdown if I stay.

If I left, I was thinking I could do supply work until my lease is up on my apartment. Or even just find work in a cafe.

1665355055.0,"Going on my second year, and I’m feeling overwhelmed to the breaking point.","Hello all,

This is going to be my second year of teaching, and I just don’t know how to handle all of what is being piled onto my plate. I know this is what I signed up for, but I’m starting to feel depressed and hopeless. I’m not looking for any advice, I just want to let out what I’ve been holding in for some time.

For a little background, I started off teaching at am elementary school near the city, and I ended up having to quit mid-year right before Christmas break because I couldn’t handle teaching at that particular school anymore. I loved my kids, but I had two that needed a lot of extra supports due to special needs and behaviors that I couldn’t provide, and neither had a para to help them while I taught. I ended up getting assaulted by one of my more challenging students, and my cries for help fell on deaf ears, so I left. It was so bad there that I ended up being on a heart monitor because I was so stressed.

I’m at a better school now, but because I left halfway through, I’m behind on mandatory LETRS training, and I feel like the pressure keeps building every single day. Every week something new is piled onto our plates and no one asks “What can we do to help you?” Or asks what they can take away from us. I spend my one hour of planning during the day grading and talking to parents and lesson planning, but more often than not I’ll have to stop because we have ten other different self-directed PDs to complete by a certain deadline. Not to mention we have an entirely new curriculum, are fumbling through it at best, and are of course dealing with behaviors that have only worsened since the pandemic. I know this is common, but I feel so burnt out and alone. I try my best to create boundaries so that I don’t work at home or on weekends, but that means I’ll be at the school until five or six. 

I just feel like breaking down and crying. I feel like I can’t even give my loved ones any attention because of my job. My boyfriend lives in another state and we are both so tired we hardly have but one call a week, I haven’t seen any of my friends in months, and my cat that I’ve had for 14 years has cancer and is dying and I feel like I don’t even have the time or energy to sit with my sadness about that. I also have lost all ability to organize and be productive. My memory gets worse and worse each day and I feel like an idiot when I forget due dates and deadlines. I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD but it is taking forever to find a doctor who will actually get me the help I need, and I feel desperate.

My plate is broken. It can’t hold anything. I want nothing more than to just teach and love my kids, but inside I feel like the whole world is caving in on me. I’m trying my best every day, but sometimes my best is just getting out of bed every morning.",TeacherReality

1664899844.0,I thought I had a great job at a great school until..,"So, I posted this as a comment to somebody’s post about admin treating them poorly but I’ve wanted to make it into a post as I’m still having trouble making sense of what happened. 

I am an educator who’s been in the field for over ten years. I’m currently getting my MA in Early Childhood Education, as this is what I teach in. I’ve been teaching preschool for the past five years and have been working at one school in particular. Last year, my supervisor left and I was asked to step up in her place. I had no prior training or experience running a preschool but I worked tirelessly with my admin day in and day out to create curriculum, build a community, maintain safety in the classrooms, and make sure the kids were well taken care of. I had built great relationships with families over the years and taught their children as well as the siblings. I was teaching a preschool 3s class and I even had a parent call to make sure I would be teaching it the following school year (this year). Since that was my class, I told her yes and she gladly told other parents who then enrolled their kids to stay in the program and continue in my class. 

During the school year I had a lot of problems with staff because most of the teachers I worked with were not teachers but more so looking for part time gigs. I heard a lot of, “well I don’t get paid enough for this shit” or “this is toddler school so it means nothing.” I also had issues with asking them to sanitize during a freakin pandemic. You would have thought I was the supervisor from hell if you asked them but I was the first director of that school that never made teachers feel guilty for calling out and told them they needed to put themselves first. I treated them like humans. I worked very closely with a teacher who was my assistant one year and then became my second in command once I stepped up. We had a great relationship until we learned she had been lying about being in grad school. Not only was this against the law, and her contract, but management didn’t want to get rid of her mid year in fear of the parents reactions.  As the months went on the lies piled up. From little white lies about prepping materials to lying about things such as being pregnant and getting surgery. I felt she was a liability but nobody took me seriously.

After such a trying and mentally exhausting year, I decided to take the summer off and return in the fall. I work at a private school so summers were not paid but you could work at the camp there. Anyways, as I was preparing to go back to the classroom, it was decided that somebody who was more qualified to be director would take over my responsibilities, and being in grad school at the time, I was ok with this. My management told me I should be focusing on grad school, which they were paying for and said I needed my masters in order to grow there. 

Fast forward to the end of summer, I tell them I got approved for student teaching and would be out of the classroom one day a week in a school my grad school placed me in. It was not up to me and I couldn’t do it at my work site. 
Once that was said, they told me I “wouldn’t be happy returning” and that they needed someone full time in the classroom even though it would only be for one semester AND they would have the staff to cover the one three hour shift a week when I wasn’t there. I figured out that once they realized they could use my salary to hire more shitty teachers as bodies, they decided they didn’t need me anymore. I rarely pat myself on the back but I did everything for them and I was honestly a model teacher. Even when parents called them angrily after hearing I wasn’t returning, they still didn’t seem to budge. 

All I wanted was to continue teaching the 3s class and as an even bigger slap in the face, they ended up giving my class to the teacher that had been lying to everyone all year. 

Basically, I’m writing this because I’ve been losing sleep over it and I’m so angry at them for kicking me to the curb. I did EVERYTHING for them. I kept a school open during Covid. I wrote their entire curriculum. I stayed up late at night with my Cricut machine making stickers and prepping activities for my kids on the regular. I built incredible relationships with families, but, I guess it wasn’t good enough? I’m still in grad school but now I’m second guessing everything. Do I even want to do this anymore? Am I a good enough teacher? I still feel so broken about it and it’s been a month now. 

Truly, I’d love to enter the field of education policy one day so I can work for the true MVPs, the mother fucking teachers. We deserve more than management could ever understand and it’s just..

So. 
Damn.

Teachers had to come to school masked while students roamed freely maskless. Our COVID sick days were reduced to 5 per year. I took medical leave for 2 weeks and ended up losing over half my monthly paycheck because the rate to pay subs is higher than my daily rate.  Had a high school kid threaten to shoot up the school during my class. Kid is returned to my class weeks later. I had no explanation of what happened during that time. Same year had a 4 hour bomb threat lockdown where students were peeing in buckets and other containers bc we couldn’t go in the hall. Thanks to tik tok, Kids were vandalizing bathrooms so most bathrooms were locked up, causing students to need to miss class for 15 min just to find the nearest bathroom. Also thanks to tik tok, it was a trend to sexually assault your teacher by smacking them on the butt. A parent wanted to interview me for what I was teaching for the ENTIRE YEAR and I was required to attend that interview. We were asked to do janitorial duties because janitors were asked to work holidays for $11/hour and so they all quit. I teach ceramics and the room lacked safe ventilation. I didn’t have my own classroom, or an office for planning and it’s kind of necessary when your an art teacher to prep materials in the room you teach in. I have a masters with 8 years of certification and was being paid less than 55k per year in one of the most expensive cities in the USA. With health insurance and everything else deducted, I was barely taking home 3500 per month. What makes this worse is that teachers are bound to an annual contract that only benefits school districts (did you know they can just move you to another school at will if they choose? Or make you teach at two schools in one day so you have to travel for lunch?) They try to make it seem like breaking a contract will ruin your career and teachers do buy into this myth.  I left teaching that year to work remote in tech in an entry level job and already get paid more after 4 months of being here.

The pay scale for SPS teachers, which depends on tenure and educational attainment, ranges from roughly $60,000 to $123,500 annually for 7.5-hour workdays (37.5-hour workweeks) and a shorter working year than people in the private sector typically endure.

Dont get me wrong, i love my kids and i dont feel anxious when im in front of the classroom teaching idk why. When i get home from work, i rest for abit and then do more work to prepare for work the next day. I hate this about the job, its like endless work. Maybe if i stick to teaching at the same school it will get better?

I also feel like im teaching kids to constantly conform to rules and not question them (how to sit or speak or behave or dress or write). Its like teaching a bunch of unique individuals to act or think the same way. Idk if im overthinking this, i jst feel like im shaping these kids to be part of the machine. The kids who question the system or the rules are considered “naughty” or “disrepsectful” and must be punished. If they dont write their essay in the structure that was taught, they wont do well.

grabbed the handle and began yanking the door handle which in turn caused the door to push me over and over again. At this point the AP showed up and the student cussed me out. Is this assault? Idk what to do. I've been teaching for 8 years and I've never experienced this.",TeacherReality

I was let go that same year because I “wasn’t doing enough” according to admin. I was upset at their reasoning but felt relief as I didn’t love teaching anyway.

I decided to take the following year off of teaching and started to look for other jobs. I have a very specialist degree and two very specialist credentials. From September to May of last year I applied to hundreds of jobs for onboarding or HR and never even got an interview. I was an emotional wreck at this point and gave in and applied to one of the better private schools for the subject I teach. 

I got the offer and accepted it. I was so excited to be done job searching. As the start of the school year has gotten closer I’m DREADING the start of the school year. I hate teaching, I’m good at it and students like me but I absolutely hate it. On top of that the school pays so little I’ll be going negative about $1,000 a month.

Principal concluded that the lounge is a ‘toxic environment’ (because we vent and discuss admin’s managerial shortcomings as well as the school problems that come as a result) so he got rid of it, saying we can share one with the school on one of the upper floors (we’re in a basement and a small school that gets bullied by the others, so we feel shy about intruding on another school.) He didn’t make his reasoning public, but I overheard him tell a custodian, “they sit in there and talk shit, they can go talk shit upstairs, I don’t have time for that.” 
Talking shit being, ‘they promised we’d have computers for students in September, it’s now March and we still don’t have anything,’ and ‘Principal cornered and verbally abused me today, here is how to protect yourself.’ We know our admin work hard and do what they can with what we have, but that doesn’t make our school not a shit-show.

***By  Zoe Yu***[ ](https://time.com/author/zoe-yu/)

***July 23, 2022 7:00 AM EDT***

***Yu is a rising high school senior and writer from Texas***

**On May 24, 19 students and two teachers were shot and killed at** [**Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas**](https://time.com/6181501/texas-school-shooting-victims-uvalde/)**—the   deadliest mass shooting in our state’s history. I remember staring at   my phone as the gut-wrenching headlines rolled in: fourth-grader** [**Miah Cerrillo**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/08/uvalde-congress-students-testify-gun-violence/) **had covered herself in her classmate’s blood to trick the shooter into thinking that she was already dead; teacher** [**Arnuflo Reyes**](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/us/uvalde-school-teacher-arnulfo-reyes-interview/index.html)**, who was shot in the arm and lung, lost 11 students in his class; and the body of 10-year-old** [**Maite Yuleana Rodriguez**](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/07/1103577387/matthew-mcconaughey-green-converse-shoes-sneakers-uvalde-maite-rodriguez) **was  so disfigured from the bullets that she could only be identified by   her lime-green Converse with a heart drawn on the right toe.  On the  news, the pictures of** [**grieving families**](https://time.com/6181718/uvalde-shooting-grieving-community/) **clinging  to one another, and of children climbing from windows and  sprinting  away from the school-turned-war zone with faces twisted in  shock and  confusion, were haunting. That same night, my friends and I  stayed up  late sharing articles and TikTok updates with the same  heaviness that  we’d felt after** [**Parkland**](https://time.com/6198426/parkland-shooting-sentencing-trial-day-one-recap/)**,** [**Santa Fe**](https://time.com/5282212/santa-fe-high-school-texas-school-shooting/)**, and** [**Oxford High**](https://time.com/6125256/michigan-school-shooting-covid/)**—now,   with the choking pain of another tragedy added to the list. It was the   dystopian familiarity of coming of age in the gun era.**

**When  I arrived at my Texas high school the next day, an administrator  was  standing at the door with a cart full of confiscated items. Of  course,  there were backpacks, which were never allowed during finals  week, but I  was surprised to see smaller bags, too—brown paper lunches,   end-of-the-year gifts for teachers—that my school had never taken up   before. Right before I could enter the building, the administrator   pointed at my laptop bag. “With what happened yesterday,” she explained   in an apologetic whisper, “we’re just on edge.”**

**I  handed over my bag without a second thought because I knew exactly how   my administrator was feeling. Like most American schools, we stop   breathing over Snapchat threats and warning messages posted to   Instagram. It’s only when the kid is caught with a gun in their pants   that we can breathe easy again, our grim relief that no one was hurt   outweighing the terror of what might have been. Because they could’ve   pulled the trigger, we face active-shooter drills that eat up entire   class periods and get trained to leave the door locked at all times, no   matter who’s begging to be let in—a peer, a principal, a best friend.   Sometimes, we even analyze hiding spots or plan for what to do if we’re   in the hallways, bathrooms, staircases, or cafeteria when the gunfire   starts, despite knowing, deep down, that nothing can really prepare us   for a moment like staring down the barrel of an assault rifle.**

**And with every school shooting—**[**27 so far, in 2022 alone**](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01)**—our fears gain legitimacy. It’s why lawmakers** [**are rallying around more armed on-campus officers**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/24/texas-republicans-uvalde-gun-control/) **and extra security checkpoints, and why Texas Republican** [**Senator Ted Cruz** ](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/sen-ted-cruz-proposes-one-door-entry-at-tx-schools-safety-experts-say-its-not-feasible)**pitched the idea of “having one door that goes in and out of the school.” Other prominent figures like** [**former President Donald Trump**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/27/donald-trump-nra-houston/) **and** [**National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre**](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/nra-wayne-lapierre-cpac-gun-rights-school-safety/2016151/) **seem to be reading from the same teleprompter flashing the same incessant buzzword: just** [**“harden” the schools**](https://time.com/6187656/school-safety-mass-shootings/)**.**

**But   while I understand that the knee-jerk reaction to violence is a push   for stronger security, I can’t help but ask questions. Why did I have to   give up my laptop bag? Why was my administrator screening for threats   like she was a TSA officer or a prison warden instead of a school   staffer? And why was my school—an educational institution—shouldering   the responsibility of checking for weapons to keep students and staff   from being gunned down?**

# Staffing shortage leads to involuntary teacher transfers at Montgomery County schools

 

**by John Gonzalez**

**Thursday, July 21st 2022** 

&#x200B;

 **MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. (7News) — Several public school teachers in Montgomery County say their summer break is coming to an abrupt end.** 

**Officials  with Montgomery County Public Schools have sent out a long list of  involuntary teacher transfers -- Some teachers received calls from  principals while on vacation. The union says the school system has  violated its contract.**

 **At Sherwood High School, close to two dozen staff members have been  relocated to other schools or told they will move into other positions,  with very little notice. Teachers report back to schools in about a  month.**

**7News  obtained a copy of the MCPS teacher contract, and it clearly states,  that principals will notify employees who have been involuntarily  transferred no later than Monday, February 28, 2022, and will provide  the (MCEA) education association a list of unit members identified for  involuntary transfer by the third Friday in March.**

**Also in the  contract it says, every effort will be made to notify the unit member of  the need for an involuntary transfer prior to the job fairs.**

 **In order to fill major staff shortages in other schools and cover  budget downfalls, some school electives and courses such as ESOL,  Women’s Studies and Business classes have been drastically reduced or  dropped.**

**Some 9th and 10th-grade classrooms already have 33 to 35 kids, more students than most classrooms have desks.**

**The  most recent school year ended with 581 unfilled positions countywide.  Meanwhile, 973 teachers have indicated they will be resigning or  retiring -- Which means class sizes are bound to increase.**

 **The teacher’s union says this situation violates the teacher contract --  several employees are being involuntarily transferred, receiving  surprise emails this week while on summer break. The union says they  should have been notified at least five months ago.** 

 **MCPS teacher resignations and retirements are up 38% in the past school year.**

**There are currently about 400 open teaching positions.**

**7News reached out to the school district and they sent us the following statement:**

***“School  systems across the country and throughout the region are faced with  challenges concerning open positions. One way to ensure that schools  have the employees needed is to transfer from a school with a surplus to  a school with a deficit, doing so ensures that students have the  teachers, administrators and support professionals needed. We are  working vigorously to recruit for all of our open positions, we do this  throughout the school year and are doing so now so that we begin school  fully staffed.”***

1658544603.0,Former teacher says he earns higher pay as Walmart professional,"  

**By: Maia Belay,** [**Nexstar Media Wire**](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/?post_type=profile&p=7076) 

**Posted: Jul 21, 2022 / 10:37 AM CDT** 

**Updated: Jul 21, 2022 / 11:10 AM CDT** 

 

**CANTON, Ohio (**[**WJW**](https://fox8.com/news/former-teacher-says-he-earns-higher-pay-as-walmart-professional/)**) — A former teacher said he is making more money as a Walmart professional.**

**Seth Goshorn taught for nearly six years, including at an elementary  school in Canton, Ohio, before deciding to change careers. It’s a  decision he said that led to an increase in pay by about $20,000 after  factoring in bonuses.**

**Dressed in his new Walmart uniform, Goshorn recorded a TikTok  video acknowledging the dramatic pay gap. He said the video  unexpectedly went viral.**

**“I didn’t think it would be this good. I might get a couple hundred  likes, so just the fact that it blew up and I’ve only been on it for  like a year,” Goshorn said. “It was really cool to see just the power of  the internet.”**

**Goshorn, who has a degree in early childhood education, is now  working as a “Walmart coach” on the management track. More than one  month into his new job, he said the transition was smooth.**

 

**“Last year I made about $43K teaching, so not anything terrible, but it also still left a lot to be desired,” said Goshorn.**



**He said he loved his time as a teacher and made lifelong friendships  with families. However, he was searching for a job that would better fit  his financial needs while planning an upcoming wedding with his  fiancée.** 

**Goshorn said working at Walmart provides professional growth without requiring a second degree.** 

**“My degree doesn’t exactly translate but the skills that a lot of  teachers have and the leadership ability teachers have does correlate to  a lot of companies,” he said. “So, find a company that’s willing to  train you for a position that might pay better.”**

**Goshorn does not discourage anyone from becoming a teacher and said  educators need additional support through increased salaries.**

&#x200B;

 **“Even though they’re scheduled for 40 hours, they’re working a lot  more than that, whether it’s teaching, grading after school,” Goshorn  said. “I coached football and track so those were other things on the  weekends. I did summer school. We don’t have all the time off that they  think.”**

**According to data referred to by the Ohio Department of Education,  the median teacher assignment salary statewide is $64,427. Salaries can  vary widely depending on which county and what school district a teacher  works in.** 

**Goshorn said he hopes his story serves as a teaching moment about the  power of the career pivot and the importance of supporting teachers.** 

**“I’m going to be a lifelong teacher,” he said. “That will always be a  part of my life, whether it’s at Walmart or on social media.”**

I taught for three years before becoming a full time technologist, and I'd heard some pretty wild stories back then. This app was inspired by one story in particular, where a female teacher friend of mine had to try to break up a fight during class between two male high school juniors. Not an ideal scenario. It would have been awesome to have a quick, discreet way to call for help.

In light of what happened in Uvalde and the lack of anybody doing anything about it, I'm releasing Little Red Button completely free and full featured (more features will be coming in the future).

It's been said that one can find a lot of narcissism amongst higher academia, medicine, law and yes, school administration. All my admin had been good (mostly) until I was in my last job (which I quit).

 The principal was one of the those ""won't someone PLEASE think of the children!"" types who created a stifling, miserable environment by enacting draconian rules/guidelines that not only hurt staff but students too (e.g. requiring teachers to keep a violent child in their class and ""deal with it"" which not only was bad for the teacher, but created am unsafe space for the other kids). She also thought it was our responsibility to turn certain students who already hated school/teachers into school loving wonder kids.

I found this article problematic for a number of reasons.  The headline is misleading.  apparently Texas has been doing this for a long time.  no surprise here, I'm sure, but there are record numbers of teachers leaving their schools across the country.

We all know why.  It's different state to state. But it's really all the same.  In nc, gop legislator killed the teaching fellows program, a state program that covers higher education costs for people who teach.  They killed the pay increase for teachers when they get a masters.  And they adjusted the salary schedule to decrease pensions.  

Then nationally teachers are feeling the brunt of fairy tale propaganda around a ""liberal agenda"" and indictrination... district policies around covid they have no control of.  And then the difficulties in teaching during a pandemic when you're ""distance learning"" one week, face to face the next, and students and teachers both are in and out, quarantined for a week or two at a time.  

It's been rough.  

I have an msa.  Principals license in nc.  When I got the masters, I learned enough to know I'd never want the job of principal.  I just say that to vet my comment.

To be fired, teachers have to be given due process.  When they have tenure, they have a 4th(?) Amendment right to their job.  That's why it's hard to fire shitty teachers.  Side note: most important job of a principal is to make sure the adults in your school are good for kids.  Due process and documentation make it harder.  But that's the job.

I wonder if it could be argued that they have the same property right to their teaching license?  I know Texas legislators granted Texas state Ed dept authority to revoke licenses for leaving mid year.  But I sure as hell don't like that.  

The challenges teachers are facing right now are really hard.  But policies like this seem to place the blame of empty classrooms on teachers, penalizing them for giving up after having taken so much abuse that they just can't take it any more.

It's a job.  You can quit.  You shouldn't face prosecution for leaving a job.  Can you think of any other job where that hapens?

 Contract abandonment is a spin term.  Beginning teachers can be fired without due process when the district simply doesn't renew the contract.  So they get you coming and going.  

Sorry this is so long.  I'm sure nobody made it this far.  But wasn't it Arizona that brought in the national guard as warm bodies in classrooms? Texas is trying to stem the flow by MAKING them stay... at least til the end of the school year.  There is an exodus happening.  And I'm afraid that the  budgetary needs across the nation to fix the problems will be prohibitive.

1647692205.0,My contract wasn't renewed and I'm so devastated,"This happened on Wednesday and I am taking it so hard. I have worked at this school in 7th grade for 6 years now, 3 1/2 as a para and 2 1/2 as a special education teacher. I got my certification while working. My job is insanely hard but I work really hard and I make great connections with my students. There was never any indication given to me that I wasn't doing a good job. I never had a review (until Tuesday, after they already knew that I was being fired), there was never a conversation, I was given no chances to improve. My coworkers all support me and think that I do a good job. I know I'm still green but I really felt like I was hitting my stride this year and starting to get the hang of it. I even sent an email to my boss saying that, though she already knew I was being let go. 

On Wednesday I was called into a room (with a union rep thankfully) and told that my contract is not being renewed for next year, but they would hire me back on as a para. This is insulting because it is about a 40% paycut, there's no way I can live on that. No reason is given, and since it's been less than 5 years, I don't think they have to give me one. 

I don't bring this up to garner sympathy, but it's important for context. I found out in December that my mom had terminal cancer and that she would be starting chemo. I am super close to my mom and she lives near me, this was absolutely devastating news. I shared this with my principal because I (naively) trusted her. She acted sympathetic at the time. I have major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. All of that was in check until my mom got sick, then I really fell off the deep end. 

At the encouragement of my principal and others (I do recognize that ultimately it was my decision) I took 3 weeks of FMLA so I could pull myself together. I saw a psychiatrist, changed my meds, started making lifestyle changes, and when I returned to work I legitimately felt so much better, and I really started feeling much better about my work. 

As I said, I am too trusting and my principal is privy to a lot of my mental health struggles but I won't get into all of that. It is important to note though, that she knows things about me that others don't which is why I think it was the impetus for my firing. I think they think I'm a wreck and not worth the hassle, and don't want to be around for the fallout when my mom passes. 

No one owes me any favors because my mom is sick, but it seems so heartless and cruel, and personal. I was never put on an improvement plan and never once told that I wasn't doing something right. My school is very supportive and I reach out for help when I need it and I am constantly eager for feedback on how to improve. I'm friends with everyone in the school, I'm friendly and well liked, and now I have to say goodbye to all these people I have worked with for 6 years. 

I also have to finish out the year, so I am reminded constantly of the pain and betrayal. I have to play it straight too because I can't get ""fired"" fired. I am hurting so bad, I feel like I'll always question other's kindness now, as I feel that is ultimately what cost me my job. Special ed is in high demand and I'm a HQT for middle school ELA, so I think I'll find a job, but it doesn't make this feel any better. Sorry this was so long, it weighs on my mind a lot.

Yesterday, I got a pretty terrific curriculum development offer. I wanted to share what worked for me, in case it’s helpful for any other soon-to-be-former teachers. 

-When it became clear that I needed to leave teaching, I started monitoring job boards for edtech and curriculum roles. 

-However, what I found more helpful was going to the individual websites for the different curriculum companies, professional development orgs etc that I’ve come to know over the years. I made a spreadsheet with the direct links to the relevant career page for each organization, so it would be easier to keep tabs on all of them quickly. 

-Here’s where luck somewhat took over. (I’m still trying to give myself credit. [ya know, imposter syndrome] but really, this was a lot of luck.)There was a posting for *three* openings in one of my specialty areas at a curriculum organization that I’ve know for years and have grown to deeply admire. 

-I applied, and then reached out to someone I sort of knew at the organization. This person was a lead curriculum designer for another content area, but I had a feeling he might be connected to this project too. I sent him an email saying basically, “You might remember me from xyz school, now I am very I interested in joining the abc team.” And he wrote back saying that he is actually the lead for the abc team had been pleased to see my application— score!

-From there, they had me do a take home assignment and a panel interview. And yesterday, they offered me the job!

-The downside is that it’s about a $10k paycut. I live in a very HCOL area, so my teacher salary was higher than average. However, the job is remote and the hours seem very reasonable. For me, the trade off is worth it.

However. 

It has now gotten to a point where there are so many escalations and disregulated students harming others (bullying, fighting, online harassment, and just straight up not letting anyone teach by yelling out and screaming at teachers) and I have no recourse aside from calling parents. Admin seem to be in survival mode and just want to keep people from physically hurting others until the end of the year. That’s it. I know they’re overwhelmed as well.

EDIT: To clarify, THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE STUDENTS. They’re having to adjust to this crazy world in the midst of so much chaos. They’re doing their best with the few resources we’re giving them. I love my students dearly and it breaks my heart that we’re in this position.",TeacherReality
1645834206.0,Pain to Pay Ratio,"I got this idea from another thread, and I haven't been able to get it out of my head all day. They were talking about how their level of pain to level of pay was really good. Like, the job was pretty painless and paid well. 

I haven't been able to stop thinking about how painful this job is vs. the level of pay we get from it. I've often thought that I do so much great quality work, plan and teach my ass off, and I barely take breaks during the day...after 10 years, I feel like I'm working like a CEO but making a salary that's like an entry level position at a ""normal job."" 

The level of pain compared to the level of pay is untenable, and I am so sure of that these days.

1645493080.0,Mental Health Resources,"We all know the state of mental health in the educational system is a complete and total mess for most of us! I thought I would share two things that have kept me from a complete and total breakdown. In all honesty, I hope that this information is not new to anyone and that everyone who needs it already has access to it! In the event that is not the case here are two resources that I hope can help some of you out there. 
Many schools and unions provide an EAP (Employee Assistance Program) as part of their benefits.  An EAP is to help provide resources for employees in a variety of areas. It can be used by everyone in your household. They provide references for mental health professionals in your area and depending on your program the EAP pays for several appointments. (The programs I have used paid for between 3 and 6 appointments.) They also provide referrals for child care, legal advice, financial advice, life coaching, etc. It is also completely confidential; they legally cannot inform your employer you have even contacted them. You can call them several times. For example, if you called about a conflict with an administrator, you can get your free sessions. You can call again about an issue with a parent and get another set of sessions. Had a fight with your husband? Call and get another set of sessions. I have not found a limit to this yet. Remember, anyone in your household can use it as well. If your spouse is struggling, they can get free sessions. If you have a child that is struggling, they can get free sessions. 
The other resource that I have found very helpful is NAMI, National Alliance on Mental Illness. I just started to be familiar with this organization. Their website has a lot of really good information. In some areas, they have support groups for people with mental illness and for their families. They have a help line 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) that is available M-F 10AM-10PM. What I found most helpful is their text line, my breakdowns tend to be in the evenings or Sundays. They have trained crisis counselors that are available for free 24/7. All you have to do is text NAMI to 741741. It has been the extra support that I needed to be able to get to the next day. 
I hope no one needs it but I feel this is a case that there is not harm in repeating it and providing it to people who might already know it. If you would like to message me about any of this information feel free to message me.",TeacherReality
1645491280.0,Do the poor working conditions filter for a personality type?,"First of all, let me first say what a relief it is to find this sub. The working conditions in teaching are NOT normal or acceptable, and it's nice to find others who can say it openly.

Second of all, I'm going to be very direct and frank in the commentary I want to make. I'm sorry if I word things awkwardly, and if there's a better way to express something, I'd appreciate some correction from others here.

Third of all, I want to speak from my own experience teaching in higher education. I have not been a k-12 teacher, though my wife is in a private school. I've been a university lecturer and college adjunct professor in a few different contexts. 

The working conditions in US higher ed are laughably bad. I used to see comically over-the-top labor abuses within the University of California, and someone described to me (accurately, I think) working as a college adjunct as being ""basically an uber driver."" I got frustrated after 3 years of the nonsense, and took an entry-level job at a luxury hotel doing manual labor. I actually made more money there even though it was a minimum wage job I could've gotten in high school, but I digress.

BY FAR the most frustrating aspect of teaching in higher education was **the other people I worked with**. I would see (again) COMICALLY over-the-top labor abuses and bureaucratic dysfunction in, for example, the University of California, but the other people in my same precarious position would bend over backwards into their own assholes to defend the schools and programs, at times as if they were defending their own families. I knew for a fact that these other lecturers had no financial incentive, had no promise of more stable working conditions, and could sometimes be under even worse conditions than I was. And yet, they pushed back against any and all criticisms of the schools/curriculum, even outside of the school in our personal lives. 

When I took entry-level jobs in the private sector, I would see similar abuses and mismanagement. The major difference was that *the other people I was working with* would openly articulate, talk about, and acknowledge that wrong things were going on. They normally would NOT bend over to defend inappropriate management, or the money guzzlers at the top. It is honestly a breath of fresh air to speak to others who can state plainly what is right in front of our faces. 

I have no sympathy for the people who are in those shitty working conditions at the universities I worked in. These were the same people who would fight tooth and nail to the death to convince me that the schools NEEDED to treat us like garbage, and that's the way it has always been, and I need to change my attitude. 

But...where in the world does this obsequies sycophancy come from? I have this working theory that I'm hoping others can help me with. 

One of the jobs that I took after getting fed up with higher ed was as an enumerator with the 2020 US Census. My gig with the census may have the biggest shitshow I have ever been a part of, and it was truly an appropriate crescendo for the Trump administration to purposefully make it into a shitshow, as the president's 1 term in office was coming to an end. 

However, the best part of the job BY FAR was going on the r/Census subreddit and shit-talking the whole thing with other like-minded people. Others had even worse experiences in the Census than I had had, with stories about inappropriate supervisors, dangerous situations that the bureau refused to rectify, and (to top it all off) the failure of the federal department to issue W-2 forms once the thing was all over. 

Somewhere along the line, towards the end of Census operations in October, something changed on the subreddit. MASSIVE amounts of people quit their census jobs, and I can only guess that not long after they quit, they stopped participating in the census subreddit. That meant that by the end of operations, rational people had already been long filtered out, and only the goobers were left. I remember that I posted a thread about a negative personal experience I had while out in the field, and I would receive replies along the lines of, ""Well, that sounds like a you problem!"", or ""You need to act more professional as a Census enumerator!"" My posts earlier into census operations WOULD NOT have gotten such responses. 

Given that I love teaching, I'm really good at it (I've gotten nothing but top evaluations in university/college settings), and I feel like I work well with middle-school aged students, I've thought about pursuing a position as a middle school teacher in a public school. Of course, here in California I would need to pay $15k for the credential that would allow me to even apply to jobs, I hesitated, but what really turns me off is the thought of the absolute wieners I may need to work with. When it comes to teachers, I've seen many things: people with personality disorders, hormonal imbalances, abusers, or mood disorders who take out their mental illness on powerless teenage students, tenured teachers who teach their class by simply having students stare at a wall for 2 hours (I've mostly seen this one in math classes for some reason), and of course the English Language Arts idealists who wish they were Robin Williams's character in *The Dead Poet Society*. The idealists concern me the most, as I see them as working with fewer professional boundaries. 

Shit conditions create a toxic workplace, in which talented and caring teachers are filtered out and only the losers are left. 

I want to leave, but then I think...my own kids are going to need to be taught in these failing systems someday. They will need to suck up to the abusive teachers with mood disorders or hormonal imbalances, and their future will depend upon their ability to get subjectively awarded letter grades from people who are lucky to have found a position paying them $40k per year. 

Am I on to something here? US schools seem to be a work environment that demands conformity to loser behaviors...right?",TeacherReality

I have been worried lately about the troubling signs of the death of our public school system. Whether it's the conservative bills aimed at teachers curriculums, or the hateful rhetoric being thrown at teachers and their unions, I can't help but feel like America is on its way to privatizing the school system entirely, which terrifies me. I fear for the families that rely on public education for their children's schooling, and that would most likely be unable to afford a private education for their children. I'm also worried, that some of the loudest voices against teachers and public schools are also some of the people who would be impacted the most by the end of public schooling in America.

So, I wanted to ask the people and teachers here some questions. I will put them in a list below:
1.) Are you worried about the death of public schools in America?
2.) If public school ends, what do you think the new system will look like?
3.) Do you believe education will still be a requirement for families, one that is punishable by law if they choose not to have their children go to school/can't afford it?
4.) Do you believe education is a right? Or is it a privilege?
5.) How do you feel the end of public schools will affect the country (if it happens)?

Reddit admin has reinstated me as a moderator (I was the third moderator down before being removed by the previous top mod) as well as the other mods. Given the mess you see before you, you are probably wondering whether I am fit for this job (I know I am wondering the same thing). 

I want to assure you we are going to work to make this community better. We want a community that is inclusive of everyone who enters into it with good intentions. This was meant to be a sub that offered the public an understanding of the daily experience of teachers and guidance to teachers who, unfortunately, felt they could not continue in the profession. It was meant as a place to improve education, not disparage it or the professionals that put in the hard work every day to improve the lives of their students.

Teaching can be hard. I have been an educator for 16 years. I have attended my students' funerals. I have made the calls to CPS. I have been helpless to stop things I knew were wrong. That does not change my unwavering faith that the work we do is just and right. 

I want this work to be more sustainable. I'm tired of watching young teachers burn out. That is why we are here-- to offer care and support.

I have to finish my work day now (snow days aren't snow days anymore), but I hope you'll hang on as we restructure and bring this sub back to life. 

P.S. Mods should serve at the discretion of the community for benefit of the community. The hardest part of all of this for me was watching as someone who did not have the community's interest at heart acting like a petty tyrant. If you have concerns about the current moderation, please state them here. If it is necessary for me to step down, I will work to ensure first that competent, caring hands have control of moderation within the sub.",TeacherReality

If you are thinking of changing careers, but think you aren't qualified..... 

Teachers are belittled and taken advantage of to ensure we are kept in our place. We are constantly micromanaged so that we don’t think we are capable of other work or functioning and having success on our own in another workplace. This micromanagement/belittling is done to keep highly qualified teachers in the place where society needs us to be in order to take advantage of us. We are capable and qualified for many other things. Not to mention higher salaries. 

If you feel like you are unqualified for a job that you want, apply anyway. Most jobs in EdTech or tech startups are figuring it out as they go along. If you don’t understand the tech lingo, you are capable of adapting to the systems and the skills that you would need are learnable skills. 

Think of how much you had to learn on the job in a short amount of time in your first year of teaching. You are adaptable; sell that in your cover letter. You adapted to the pivot from in-person to online learning and you probably did it overnight; that makes you tech savvy. Be confident in yourself because you are worth more than you realize.

My class average is like a 33 and the only reason I let them slack off is because I cannot help that they were conditioned to not do any work, but the principal still expects that they pass for graduation rates to look good.

We have some interim admins and a new super. My 3 evals, last year went up consecutively. This year my veal numbers are heading in the wrong direction. I just had my second of the year today and it was bad.

Those who evaluated me last year seemed very caring and like they were genuinely interested in making sure I improved. This year it’s much different, as a non-tenured teacher I feel my job is always at risk. I do not want to feel like this for another two year.

My lesson was not perfect but I felt that it was harsh given the sample size and context of the lesson. I feel that both observations I’ve had this year the take away is, “I would have done this, so that’s what you should have done.” I never want to lose my individuality as a teacher. 

It seems to add what they want in every single one of my lessons getting through the curriculum is out of reach and would take hours more planning. Some nights as is I plan and make materials till 10 or 11 pm. I don’t know how much more I can mentally give. 

I am very passionate and love my students, perhaps it’s an obvious bias, but I feel like I am an effective teacher.  These observations and administrators are making me feel down on myself, worried about job security, and like maybe this isn’t for me.

I stand up and I see him sitting there, his face all read as he's telling F that he's tired of his shit.  He keeps repeating, ""I'm tired of your shit!"" He slams his iPad down on the desk and stands up. The whole time I'm trying to get them to stop yelling at each other, but they have no interest in me in the slightest. F stands up as well, posturing to fight. They're at the verbal threats phase when I make it to the phone and dial for assistance.

The interventionist asked one of my co workers in PLC today where she was at on the unit and my co worker respectfully said she was not following the unit calendar but was still teaching the same material. The gifted teacher began to blow up at her and got angry that my co worker was not using this plan because it ""fit the prociency scale perfectly"". She continued to lay into her for no good reason and then thankfully, the bell rang. 

Fast forward to the afternoon PLC meeting. My other co workers brought up the incident so I said that I think what we were trying to convey this morning is that her and I are trying to meet the students where they are at skills wise. The gifted teacher then proceeded to lay into me and YELLED at me because ""there's no difference between any of the students on other teams"". Except that... I teach the ELL, intervention, and iep kids. She was so rude to me and then the advanced English teacher jumped in and literally said this comment to me ""that's what teaching is, we break things down so that the kids can understand it"". All I was trying to explain to them was that I had started the unit plan last week from day 1 and decided today that I was going to go back and re teach claim, evidence, and reasoning. It really was the most unprofesisonal thing I have experienced.

I found out from my co teacher that one of the 8th grade teachers leaves PLC in tears whenever the gifted teacher attends their meetings. This is not an isolated incident. 

I felt so undermined in that moment as a professional. I was shaking when I went to my meeting with my instructional coach because I was about to cry. I explained to my coach what happened and we sat down to go over the proficiency scale. She told me I was right on target and to focus on students building a strong argumentative paragraph instead of a five paragraph essay.

This was a scary situation and I felt very alone. I would like to give some clarification of this incident as well as an update. Warning, it's still in progress but so far it hasn't been great. For context, I work with high schoolers in a rural town.

The situation was this: I was observing the lunchroom when he made a comment about someone's ass. I turned around and he said ""Why'd you turn around?"" In the moment I was very confused and it seemed like he had been speaking about me. As I stated, I informed my supervisor and principal. The next day the student found me while I was doing bus duty and he started yelling at me. When I informed the Principal, she later asked me if I would be willing to sit down and discuss it with him to ""take my power back"". We just had the meeting today...two weeks later.

The student alleged that they had been ""talking about their friend behind me"", and I just happened to turn around. I told him how bad it looked, and how he had no right talking to *anyone* that way. And that the reason why I had approached the principal about the situation was that if anyone looked at the incident from an outside perspective (adult and minor flirting), I could lose my job. I had to protect myself. I reiterated that his aggressive approach to me after the incident did not help his case either. He apologized for his behavior and for ""any unnecessary trauma he may have caused."" Whether he meant it or not is still up for debate...

I am currently in the process of trying to set up a meeting with HR to discuss how this was handled. How it felt like this was taken lightly, and not as serious as it could be. How I did not feel safe the, again, *two weeks* it took to set this meeting up. I asked for a male coworker to stand with me during bus duty just to feel slightly safer at my own job.

I also have informed my Union Rep, though technically I'm still in the process of having my application accepted. She is on my side and has been supporting me through all of this.

I'm sorry this isn't the big, badass update you all may have been wanting. But I'm still trying to find my footing in this. I promise I won't stop and let this slide.

I don't know if there's a way to word this without it coming off as maybe a little offensive but I am curious the thoughts of teachers on it.

I've been following the events of the last several years in regards to education. It seems like half the country just has a pretty anti-education stance at this point. They're banning books, parents are threatening teachers and administrators at board meetings, the kids seem to be out of control and not to give a shit largely... Cities don't properly fund schools so that teachers are expected to teach more and more kids each class to the point where it just seems impossible to do a good job. Schools are putting kids in debt for food... Also if you think of the salary that teachers get as a metric of how valued they are by society it's not good and honestly it's never been good. A huge and disproportionally powerful chunk of society just seems to be making it their personal mission to make the profession shittier.

My question is, why don't you just throw your hands up and go fuck it, fuck these kids and their stupid parents. The parents want to tell me how to teach, you teach your dumb kids then and they're going to grow up to be dumb fucks just like you, not my problem anymore. Do you feel trapped in the profession because it's what you went to school for? You're all smart people wouldn't a company want to hire you for something? Why not just quit and wash your hands of it all and just stop thinking about it. The country doesn't value education anymore and that seems to be getting worse so why not just give up on it?

I'm not a student or a parent and I never will be a parent so maybe that's why I have this attitude? I vote on increasing the budget and funding for schools whenever possible but I feel like people just don't value it, they don't want to pay for it.

1642700113.0,"Teachers punching kids, my controversial (?) take.","If you're not aware of it, there was a video posted a little while ago where a kid is being terrible, the teacher reaches a breaking point, and the teacher swings.

*Tldr at bottom*

Down near the bottom of that thread, you'll find my comments. Which I acknowledge were poorly phrased, and you'll see they got a lot of downvotes. I want to take a second to express myself better, and hopefully have a discussion, if people still disagree with me and want to downvote that's cool I'll eat it.

When we see a teacher taking a swing at a kid, and all we do is condemn the teacher or applaud the teacher, we're missing the chance for a good conversation. It should go without saying that it is almost never appropriate for an adult to hit a kid.

Just in case it's not clear, the teacher should not have hit the kid.

With that said, I don't think we can just condemn the teacher and walk away. We have to condemn the systemic failings that put the teacher in that situation in the first place. Because it's easy to judge from the other side of a keyboard. But every single person has a breaking point.

I am not a teacher right now, specifically because I knew it was not good for me to be somewhere where I was going to have to dance on that line.


**Back to the controversial thought.**

In America we have primary positions where we expect people to deal with the public as an authority. Teachers, and cops. I'm going to leave out my political opinions on cops, because I don't think it's worthwhile in this discussion, but I will simply say that de-escalation should play a much higher role, and violence a much smaller role, in policing.

Regardless, cops have a pretty big tool belt when it comes to carrying out their objectives, maintaining their authority, and trying to feel safe. Regardless of abuse, that's not the topic, there are a lot of tools.

What tools do teachers get? Ask nicely? Call the office and hope they come down?

And as a cop, you're not in a high stress situation from the moment you clock into the moment you clock out. Even on the worst beat, you've got a partner, you can go back and hang out in your car for a little bit, back up is always waiting to come. It's not you on the streets by yourself for 8 hours straight with pretty much no help.

You remind me of the horrors I used to hear in the teacher's lounge. Teachers saying horrible things about their students in their back. What the fuck was wrong with them? And with some of you?

Now I understand it probably was not a coincidence that I was the **only** teacher in the whole school that had a great relationship with the students, with my classes always being kind-of-quiet, never losing my composure... and that I was the only one who seemed to respect the students as actual people.

1642655762.0,First Year Teacher and I Already Believe I'm a Terrible Instructor and Ready to Leave,"Hey everyone,

I apologize for the long rant I am about to make. I just feel so lost and need some advice on job opportunities. Please skip to the end if need be. I just need to get my thoughts out somewhere.

As the title states, I am a new teacher who is teaching English, and I never had the opportunity to student teach before the pandemic hit. Got a job across the state after finishing my master's in theater (English BA), and I was so excited to be pursuing my desired career and not living off unemployment looking for anything to survive. The salary is the best I have made in my life so far (late 20s for reference), which is sad, yet I thought it was the start to a wonderful stage in my life to begin helping out kids and doing my best to be an effective instructor...that is up until now. 

I.feel.awful. I am a terrible teacher. No one prepared me for what things would be like. I had an understanding that the first year or two may be rough, yet not like this. I know I am going to make many mistakes, yet didn't expect to receive such backlash from students and parents, and I feel so worthless. While my admin and fellow teachers are supportive and say this will pass and to just survive, I feel like I have been thrown to the wolves. No resources or guidance given to me on what to teach, and every unit and lesson plan I make is on the fly. Every day I am just wondering how a lesson or unit will go that I can create on my off time, since my planning periods are busy covering for teachers out from covid. Some days are great, and many other days the lessons don't work. That's fine, it's part of the growing pains right? That's what I want to believe...I want to believe I am doing the best I can with the hand I have been dealt, yet still feel like a joke of a teacher.

The kids overall are just disrespectful and nasty to me. I feel like I am failing them, yet I am trying so hard and learning as well. Even with how they treat me, I care about their education and want them all to be successful. Some are wonderful and enjoy the theatrical display I put on as I pretend I am not screaming internally and teach them what I can, yet it is exhausting. My mental health has plummeted. I dread going to work or having to talk with my students.

 I let teenagers get to me as they give me lip and don't pay attention or refuse to do work...and these are honors students. They view any new teacher as inferior and not worth their time. Even when they haven't been taught a good amount over the last few years, like writing a properly formatted essay...they just don't follow and refuse to believe I know what I am talking about...and when I don't give them As because they did it wrong or was written poorly? Parents come lashing out because I am a problem teacher. Their child never fails, so it's my fault they are. How dare I not give them an A like others do. The ones who don't even turn it in? Admin says give them a 50 at best. Don't give Fs otherwise. Never a 0.

I try my best to be patient with them and not lose my cool, because it's not professional or right to raise my voice in a mean way or return the nasty behavior. On the days where I can get students to follow along and learn, I feel a little better about myself...until the moment I make one tiny mistake, and I am jumped on. As for admin helping me with behavior? A slap on the wrist for that kid being rude and they are fine as they don't want to ""upset the parents"". 

I feel helpless. Does it get better? Did I pick the worst time to jump in as a new teacher during a pandemic? Or is this the reality and future of education in the US? Am I just bad at this job? I am just so unhappy and tearing myself apart mentally and it's affecting my life outside and my personal relationships. 

To all of the teachers who have had more years of experience and go through this; I absolutely respect you. I feel weak and mentally soft for feeling this way after only five months. I don't know how many of you are still doing this. The only reason why I feel motivated to even go to work is because I feel like I have no other way to get a job with a reasonable income. 

Should I just quit? I don't even know what jobs a new English teacher with minimal experience in education could do. I have mostly been a student before this. I just feel so lost and defeated and I feel terrible writing this. For those who have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my rant. I am already considering finding a therapist to help me out with my depressed state. I just need to know what routes to even consider. 



TL;DR: New English teacher with no prior experience, not even student teaching. I feel like a terrible teacher and the job and treatment from students and parents has left me in a dangerously depressive state. Looking for a way out to save my well being, or the advice to tough it out.",TeacherReality

Well, I got word that tomorrow I’m going to be informed that I will be formally written up for breaking up a would be fight- I didn’t touch any student, I did use an object to move one  student away, but no one was even the slightest bit hurt. The parent of the aggressor is apparently pushing this because their child said I threw something at him, which definitely did not happen. There were no security cameras in place to record anything and no other adults around, just a class full of kids, so it’s my word against the (one) kid’s. These were younger students but old enough to seriously hurt one another, something which I have seen happen and have prevented on many occasions. So anyway, apparently I’m going to be written up. I’m also not a part of the teachers union (I guess if you’re planning on staying I would recommend joining yours if you have one).

1643106953.0,How to escape from Teaching to Tech: an easy guide,"##Why?

- High employment
- Huge salaries
- Really not so hard
- Often can work remote
- Your boss HAVE TO make you happy because you can just quit

##Which industry?

- Video games, software development, webdev...
- Webdev currently a very good choice, lots of demand, good work condition, high salaries. I only know webdev, so I will talk here about webdev.

##Is it easy?

Nothing worth doing is really easy. It is a LOT of work, because there are a **lot** of things to learn. It can be a very pleasant experience depending on your situation and interests, or it can be not for you at all.

This article will try to list everything that can help you or impede you. If you have a lot of positive points, you should definitely do it. If you don't, then maybe not.

##Which skills are needed?

- Passion for programming: huge advantage, but not mandatory.
- Ability to sit in front of a screen for long times (or stand, you WILL invest in a standing desk eventually)
- Talent: Some people learn faster than others. Some people start with an affinity for computer logic. You don't need talent to succeed, but talent will help you achieve your goals faster.

##Can anyone do it?

- Some people can't learn programming at a decent pace.
- Most people can succeed in a couple years.
- Some people can succeed in a very short time (6 months to a year)

Teachers are often bright people, so most of you should be in 2nd or even 3rd category.

ADHD/Autistic people usually succeed very well from what I've seen (conditions apply).

Note: these estimations are assuming you are in the ""unemployed"" category. If you work full-time on the side, it can be much longer.

##Personal advantages:

- You have a network of programmers around you (friends, family)
- Non-native English speakers: you speak English fluently

##Personal disadvantages:

- You have kids. It's already a lot of work, a lot of pressure, and a lot of interruptions while you study. Still possible, but it makes it harder.

##How to learn?

- Self-taught works: online MOOCs and courses.
- Paid bootcamps: Sometimes bad. Sometimes very expensive. Sometimes great. Need to check what they're teaching, ""real"" reviews from alumni, etc.
- 42 free coding school: In Paris and Silicon valley (maybe other places). I recommend it if you can get past the entrance exam. Don't need to finish the full 3-years, you can leave after one.

Other considerations: You need to work on Unix for most technologies, so either install Linux, or if you have too much money and you don't hate apple then buy a mac.

Additionally, you should balance your time between practicing and learning. Practicing should go first, until you're blocked, then it's time to learn. Once you know enough to unblock you, go back to practicing.

##What to learn?

Full guides here: [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/)
Frontend is a good choice for starters and a good entry to the job. You can also aim to enter as backend or fullstack, but you need some frontend knowledge anyway.

The guides are a good resource, but you should also check where you live/where you WANT to live and see what's the most sought after there.

##When to learn?

- While working on the side (so on evenings, weekends): Difficult, but might be doable. Might take a much longer time.
- Quitting your job to study: Much easier, but you need to be able to support yourself financially.

##Timeline for self-taught webdev

To learn a new technology, you usually start with lessons and short exercises (i.e on [websites like this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)). Then I would advise to build a decent-size project to really be sure you're past tutorial hell (see below). This project should take at least a couple week of full-time work.

Then keep learning highly researched new technologies. When you know ""enough"", start looking for a job. ""Enough"" might be HTML/CSS/Javascript + React + other stuff like Git (see guides).

While you're actively looking for a job, keep working on personal projects.

Finally, know that ""writing working code"" is not enough, you need to produce Enterprise-grade code. Read about ""Best practices"". Try to find a mentor to guide you on this vast topic.

##What are the biggest challenges?

- Tutorial hell: when you are able to do ""coding exercises"", very small projects, small web pages, but are unable to start a real project which scales in complexity. No easy solution for this except practice, practice, practice.

- First job: The first job is the hardest to get. The reason is that rookie developers actually cost more to a company than they bring, and once they start working efficiently they often leave for a better job. So companies have little incentive to hire you out fresh out of school.

Once you are past 2 years experience as a developer, [you are worth more than money](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/companies-worry-more-about-access-to-software-developers-than-capital.html) and will never be hungry again.

1697257011.0,My age is impacting my authority?,"Hello! I’m a 20yr old female dance teacher who is having trouble garnering respect from my students, fellow dancers, and some fellow teachers. For some context my fellow dancers are around high school age and my students range from 3-10yrs old. I also happen to default to saying “yes” when it comes to helping others in my free time, I am diagnosed with autism (the faculty are aware) and I have taught in a public school and in a ballet company. 

I believe that my age is impacting my authority because a parent of a student who was acting out in class said that I looked like a, “big sister” instead of a teacher. I have also been talked down to by the high school dancers because I am supposedly too old to be allowed to sit somewhere even if I got there first or I have seniority in the company. However, these same dancers would make way for other dancers my age with the same skills if they happen to guest for our company. I was also kinda forced to massage one of the senior eachers because I was not busy. They did not stop to ask if I was ok with it. 

I have been in therapy and am now learning that people can take advantage of you, but I want to develop authority at least equal to my position in the school. I have been working on declining things that I am not interested in doing, but I still have trouble with saying “no” in the moment. Is there any way to change my reputation at my school? It’s pretty abysmal right now, but I would like to change how people treat me for the better. This is the only dance school near where I live that also puts on major productions where I have met wonderful guest artists, so I do want to stay.",TeacherReality

1695876265.0,Tonight I was scolded by a parent for telling their kid to quiet down.,"I am a high school music teacher who often takes students to events after school. Tonight we were on a bus and the students were very exuberant,  talking and laughing loudly.  One girl in particular had a very high pitched -ear piercing laugh which was bothering our bus driver who asked her to stop. The kids ignored the bus driver, so I stepped in calling the girl’s name and asked her to quiet down. (Loudly in order to be heard over the commotion)

As parents often come to these events, the parent s of the loud girl approached me very upset that I had yelled at their child in front of a bus full of students which embarrassed her. They also felt the need to explain to me that their daughter has a loud voice and I should understand that she can’t control it. 

So, I’m not supposed to control a situation where a child’s high pitched laugh is distracting a bus  driver in fear that I might embarrass the kid? How does this make sense?

I work for a Montessori school for preschoolers as an assistant and have been there for almost a year. We have a very high turnover rate for assistants cause we were always understaffed and people leave constantly. I’ve given my 2 week notice and was asked to stay one more week as we have some staff that are out for vacation. I ended up agreeing cause I felt bad and wanted to show how dedicated I am even if I’m leaving. Side note, I personally feel like the parents trust me more than the newer assistants since I’ve been there longer than then. So some parents I feel like are comfortable talking to me about their child’s day or progress. The other day I was called by my assistant director and director to the office, saying that a parent “complained” that I made their child seem like they are terrible or bad… and a couple days before I was talking to that same parent informing her that I’ll be leaving and of course she was saying that it’s sad for them to see me go. I also was telling her that I will miss working with her kid since her kid is in preschool and I was assigned for toddlers that week I am originally for preschool and hated that they’ve put me in toddlers since I’ve never worked with toddlers on top of that I told them that I would like to keep my 9-5 schedule and I have communicated to them long time ago that I prefer not to close but still they’ve put me on a closing shift. She made a sly comment saying “ugh I wouldn’t want to be in toddlers, I think I can be with infants” since I felt like we were in a joking kind of conversation I responded to her jokingly “don’t be fooled”(about the infants) apparently the same parent mentioned this to my director and was pretty much told by my director and asst. director to avoid parents at all costs and to shut up and just be very positive. side not our previous lead teacher called cps and licensing on this place. There are so much other dramas that went on but it’s too long to add here.Now I feel awful since all I just care about their child but don’t meant anything by it. But I dislike working at this place and I’m really unhappy which is why I’m leaving. I’m so traumatized after I was called into the office for this reason. I feel even worse that I’m on my last week and I feel so attacked. This place has caused me so much anxiety all throughout my stay. I guess my unhappiness is reflecting on the way I communicate?

1690805488.0,Moving Around Before Exiting,"Where you teach, who you teach, who you teach with, what you teach, who your boss is all matter immensely. Some schools do an excellent job with mentoring and supporting new teachers. Some schools are best for veteran teachers on the verge of burnout. During my first few years, I hopped around a bit: I taught in a small CA Catholic middle school, a rural Virginia middle school, a small CA private secular K-8 school. Then I moved to NYC and I taught at a large Title 1 high school NYC closed down, a new small Title 1 grades 6-12 NYC public school (aftermath of the closing down) for 9 years. I then moved South and taught in Maryland at two charter schools, one located in DC. I then took a job at a very large (academically) high performing suburban Maryland high school. All have their strengths and weaknesses, upsides and downsides. If you are someone who craves meaning and seeing a relatively immediate positive impact on others as I do, I advise frustrated teachers to try a variety of settings and, if you can, and move when things get stale before giving up on the profession completely. Also, don't be afraid to switch subjects. I taught math at the private schools, got bored, and then got certified in English. Middle school kids were driving me crazy so I picked up an ESOL license through Praxis, allowing me to teach any grade. Later I did the same with social studies. This helped me get away from the massive amounts of grading. Happy now although I sometimes miss my colleagues and the family-like environment from the high pressure Title 1 schools.

1690122208.0,I got a write up during the summer for having anxiety,"So, it seems I need a new way to share my vents, my frustrations, my joys just all of it.  So, let me give a little back story.  Last year at the end of the year we learned that we had 3 APs leaving, one being my evaluator and the other two being over scheduling along with our director of Special Education who I bonded with this year as a first-time small group teacher.  This mean that for the first time since I've been working at this school I left with no clue of what I might be teaching next year and absolutely no idea as to who I'll be working with in my direct chain of command.  

A friend of mine put up a post about all the changes he wants to make to improve himself and his school year this year.  I commented telling them I was anxious because of the information above.  That's when I learned a few things.  1) They have a teacher rat on their FB.  2) My fears about this principal which had been subsided after their being here for two years were actually founded. 3) Having anxiety is a negative reflection of the school and a violation of social media policy (WTF!!!!).

So, obviously someone had to tell the principal what I commented because per social media policy both our accounts are friends only and the principal isn't a friend on either account.  So, I get a call from the principal berating me for having anxiety about the year.  Accusing me of being ungrateful because they had fended off issues and defended me as a teacher last year (um as long as I'm not doing anything wrong isn't that their job?).  The icing on the cake though was their telling me that if I have anxiety, I should be going to a therapist to fix my problems not sharing them with coworkers because they can't be on any assistance to my mental health.",TeacherReality

Everyone is stressed, off sick, injured from pupil assault. Ya know. Normal. 

Workload has been ratcheted up constantly because the school appointed some middle leaders from the money they don't seem to have. They need to justify their position so they've been making paperwork exercises. 

Teachers. Classic teachers. Fucking teachers. 

Meeting starts. We are told we will be creating a 900/1000 word planning document every half term based off *planning that is already online*. Yes. So we're going to copy and paste the content into a document, add some word soup and promises of differentiation that will probably not happen. 

Teachers all nodding. The same teachers who complain about workload and understand there's no time for this. I'm looking around wondering if they've done the translation yet. It roughly translates to 

""hey fuckers, you know that holiday you get to try and rebuild your shattered mental health?... how about we take another day of it off you... because this pointless fucking document HAS to be on the system by 9am on the first day. Not for students. For us""

No one says anything. The cat flap in an elephant house effectiveness senior leaders grin mindlessly knowing more work is being done. That must be good right? Do they wonder how much more work can be ratcheted up? No. Because that would require an understanding of management beyond unrealistic ungrounded mindless aspirations based on falsity.

1686837821.0,Career Advice,"Hi All, 

I work for a large urban district. We are surrounded by smaller suburban districts that do pay significantly more money (with less education requirements for top salaries). Here’s the catch: my district pays significantly more from years 1-10, it’s only after that point where the suburban districts leave my district in their dust.

For example, with a master’s plus 60 credits (or three master’s degrees, or one doctorate), my district’s top base salary is $105k after ten years. A suburban district will pay a base of $125k after 15 years with only a master’s plus 30 credits.

My salary is increasing by $6k starting this summer, but if I went to this suburban district at the equivalent salary step, my income would basically be the same as it was this year. 

So what would you do? Take a pay cut for a decade to reap the higher salary for the second half of your career, or decrease your total career’s earnings by about $300k and stay in the current district?

Thanks!",TeacherReality
1686712632.0,Blackout protest,"So... Elephant in the room: Why hasn't
r/TeacherReality joined the Reddit protest when so many adjacent subs have? The mod team hasn't spoken about it, so this is just me talking. But there is stuff worth saying.

First and foremost reason, in my mind, is that the community has not called for it. The first meta thread about the protest on the sub was posted today. If/when the community calls for action, the community will decide and we moderators will follow. What ""decided"" looks like in a site filled with bots and alts is a bit hard to nail down, but the decision rests with the community, not its moderators.

Second, I mod a few subs, one of which has joined the protests (the others are too small for it to be much impact either way). I would say that the purpose of *that* sub is entertainment, which is not the reason *this* sub exists. 

Our primary purpose is to offer a place for teachers to receive support in the tough choice many make to leave the profession. Summer is the time when many make that choice. When someone leaves their school, they may be leaving their support system, their friends, and reevaluating much about their life. This is a place to remind them that they still have value (both economic and *human* value). I don't want to shut down that life line just when someone might need it.

I've been teaching for 19 years-- I'm going to keep teaching-- but I've seen too many colleagues and friends broken, by what was the toughest choice they ever faced, for me to pull the rug out from under anyone who needs the help-- even for a moment. There are school admins, HR departments, and even colleagues out there who will make people feel like their humanity and wellbeing is a small price to pay for test scores-- we are a counter narrative to that.

Does that excuse anything Reddit is doing? No. I am personally horrified, especially by the shutdown of apps that provide accessibility where Reddit does not. 

If the sub decided that it was time to go dark, would I press the button? Sure. 

Is that my decision to make? I don't think so.

Our school has two campuses. The other one is a huge mess and all the middle school teachers threaten to walk out. My principal was asked to intervene and help for a few weeks. And I guess their principal is now gone.

We had a standing meeting last Monday to learn that over the weekend one of our students parents called the police because he found a pistol and AR in the kids bedroom. Upon further investigation admin found out there was a TikTok of this kid showing his buddy the guns in the school bathroom the week before. The day this kid brought them to school he was supposed within the first 32 minutes for flipping off a teacher. Based on his history we believe he intended to use them.

What did admin do? Sent out communication to parents 3 days after telling staff about it but said ""weapon"" even though we clearly knew it was a gun. Also, this situation could have been completely avoided because the kid sold pot gummies on campus the second week of school. He should have been charged with a felony and expelled then. No, we let him stay and be spent 27% of his year causing enough issues to be suspended. The kid that took the video in the bathroom for him? I found his TikTok and he's also a little prick. He thinks he's so tough and cool, his parents also bought him a shotgun for his birthday. Yet another kid that should've been expelled long ago for constant suspensions.

We have 1.5 days left and I feel like every day I go home I'm just thankful to still be alive. This whole event sends the message of: ""we don't care about your safety as long as these kids learn"". I signed a contract in a new district for next year and cannot wait to be out.",TeacherReality

How can you use positive reinforcement on a child who is received many warnings about being mindful about their body and surroundings but still constantly get hurt.  It has been going for 3 weeks.

I got so frustrated that I let the child know that I am scared to take them on summer field trips. If there is a 4th week I will put my foot down and ask one of their parents to go with. But ik for a fact they won't bother to come. They NEVER have.

ANYWAYS

No shock today and with my luck they went home and had a limp but didn't tell staff. And I get a message from mom along with my much now regretted statement of "" I'm scared to take them on field trips."" (Let mom know it was regrettably mentioned)

 I've already noted and know that they get overly excited before the transition to outside or new activites. I ask them to walk to the ""calm couch"" and to show me what relaxed and clam means. (If they are not running they are stomping and angry/screams because I am asking them to relax & calm down and even then the success rate is maybe 65%)
But this morning and my luck, they run to the couch and adds in a head into the wall. 

How do you turn running into the wall a positive reinforcement situation even after many warnings and told what behavior is to be expected? (*** please walk to the calm couch and relax) I've done my part to see what triggers cause these actions but its following through directions and listening isn't going though. 

Maybe I say and do ""I see that you ran into the wall, that's why the direction was to walk. Here is a hug,ice pack and an hour me panic observing to make sure you don't have a concussion"" 

Where do I add the ""rewarding or reinforcing desirable behavior in order to increase the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated in the future""?(google)

SO 

In my response, I told her ""How does after a couple of reminders to *** about being mindful of how our surroundings can affect our body or the choices that we make can affect our body. We can have *** sit next to a teacher for a calm break until *** is ready to try again."" 
 But it's still the same strategy I have used just different places and clearly it's not positive enough. Obviously reminders only can go so far.

Yesterday, my district received mass threats to middle schools throughout the district. Parents were advised to speak with their children and student absences were all excused. Here’s where i’m fucking pissed:

We, as their teachers, were not given ANY information. We were not told which schools received a threat (it’s a big district) and we were not told exactly what the threat entailed. We were also NOT encouraged to stay home like students were. they didn’t acknowledge us at all, actually. I was literally sobbing this morning on my way to work because I was so terrified. I said goodbye to my husband, my cats, my best friend and parents, hell I even drafted a goodbye note for my best friend to give my husband “just in case”!!!

Maybe it was stupid of me to not call out immediately, but we live in such a society where I feel BAD for wanting to protect MY OWN LIFE over the lives of other peoples kids that I have no relation to. Don’t get me wrong, I adore my students but I JUST got married. I JUST turned 25 (literally yesterday, got the email at my literal birthday dinner so that was fun /s) I have had unrelated health issues recently that has caused me to miss multiple days so close to the end of this school year and i felt bad calling out when I “didn’t need to” 

My roommate woke up to see me walking out the door sobbing my eyes out and so I told them what was going on and why I was still going in. How I didn’t know which schools were under threat and it was a small chance it was my school since the district was so big so “it will probably be fine” They told me to text my principal and ask if she had more info (this hadn’t even occurred to me, idk why) and she responded that it was in fact our school that was directly under threat. I told her immediately that I was staying home which thankfully she understood and wasn’t upset at all. 

It just PISSED me off that we as teachers got NO INFORMATION. There was nothing communicated that we were under investigation or called out. I had to ASK. Why didn’t they just close the school down?!? I spent the entire day stressed out of my mind and looking at the news every hour to see if there were any updates. We ended up getting a district wide email saying that the poster was arrested and would be charged accordingly, and thank fucking god that nothing happened but what the hell has america come to?!

1677549397.0,"Here's My Experience: I have no one to tell, so I'll tell you.","I need to express what I'm going through somewhere, and this seems like an okay place to do it. I often see people posting here in a rather negative way about students, but to be honest I don't find the students to be what makes this a punishing job. I became a teacher through TFA, so I have only worked in Title I schools. Fights break out, property gets damaged, and students can be generally noisy, mean, and way less mature than society expects, but I find that the way I treat students has a huge influence on how they respond to me. I have noticed at the schools I have worked at that the teachers most likely to complain about how horrible students are happen to be teachers that are mean and sometimes say dehumanizing things to students. They also happen to be teachers who are pretty ""old school"", and don't feel like its worth their time to bother keeping up with best practices in the field.

In short, I'm pretty new at this but student behavior is not something I prioritize as a problem. It may be that I came into teaching as what TFA calls a ""career changer"", and I am bringing my previous experience with me, which has happened to be pretty helpful in the classroom.

What makes this job such a demoralizing and demeaning experience is the school district... well, the system in general. There is just too much about how education works that honestly just seems like a stupid idea. What feels good to say is that the district seems like it's run by idiots.

When I started writing this post, I expected that I would be able to explain some of why I believe this. But now I'm running out of time to write, and I don't even know where to start because it's so overwhelming. I have worked in about two dozen organizations and I have never seen anything approach the level of incompetence and dysfunction that I am observing in this school district, full of people none-the-wiser going about their business as if this stuff was normal.

There are lots of valid criticisms about Teach For America, but one thing that they seem to do well is to expose incoming teachers to the most current practices in teaching, and give you a pretty formidable crash course on theory. One would think that a summer crash course on literacy education and pedagogy is but a humble beginning compared to the experience of education leaders who have a decade or more under the belt. This is what I believed. 

I shit you not, I have come to the slow awareness over my time teaching that the TFA crash course plus my previous work experience and unrelated degree have left me more prepared to do this right off the bat than a lot of people seem like they are after years. I do not feel proud of myself and am not bragging about this. Rather, it's the story of a slow horror that has been making itself known to me. Like, really? How is it that I have a better idea of how to do this than the people whose jobs are allegedly to tell me how to teach?

I have educators in my life that are inspiring, and I admire some public leaders in education as well. Of all the people who have a say over what I am doing (there are about seven *seven* ***SEVEN PEOPLE*** observing my classroom and leaving orders for me---no wait... EIGHT) one. *one.* **ONE OF THEM** is a person who obviously has good leadership skills, builds relationships with students and teachers skillfully, is extremely knowledgeable about teaching practices AND gives amazing feedback. ONE OF THEM, and it's the one that gets bulldozed the most by the others because this person is at the bottom of their hierarchy.

Could be worse. I trust my administrators' intentions and I like them. I've been disappointed by some of their decisions---I don't know what makes them think that asking me to explain my lessons over and over is a more helpful use of time than letting me reflect and come to our coach for feedback (coach with specific and recent experience in my subject area, or admin without experience in this core subject... which is more helpful?), or what makes them think that scolding me (""you better do it!"") is a good way to get the results they want from me when I am a grown-ass adult who is clearly intrinsically motivated to grow in this role. Actually, does anyone really need to be harassed into doing this job? Is it even possible? Who is even left teaching besides people who are stuck waiting for retirement and people who have some good personal reasons to even try it? I think that when they feel harassed and infantilized by their bosses, they decide to just pass it on.

As far as admin are concerned, that job is absurdly hard and overwhelming, but administrators who don't learn to fully trust the people who are working under their authority are just going to make it harder for themselves. That's true in every organization. 

Why my administrators feel that way is because they themselves have to report to a micromanaging hierarchy of people who maybe aren't people's favorite to work with. One would imagine that being a psychopath and sadist is a prerequisite for work in that department. There are so many cooks in the kitchen... I mean, we could totally better use that money to hire coaches and ESE teachers, but my district instead decided to create an out-of-touch, pompous hierarchy. Instead of sending work down the hierarchy, there are FOUR levels of this hierarchy that directly engage with us at the classroom level. They don't say anything---they mostly seem to try to avoid interacting with teachers. But they have opinions. And this entire organization is run according to their opinions. Not policy, not a concrete and transparent set of criteria... just their often inconsistent opinions. So we are left scrambling at the bottom to meet their often different expectations, which are sometimes incompatible with each other.

Their opinions are the worst. They insist that we adopt these awfully lazy teaching practices that they think are good teaching. They think they are rigorous. Putting their ideas to work in my classroom only makes things worse. I did it because I was sure I'd collect data on how it's worse, and I do have some. But now no one is interested in looking at my data. lol.

I teach students in historically poor neighborhoods. The overwhelming majority are from recently immigrated families or African-American families. I have students that have extremely poor self-management skills, short attention spans, and I imagine are neurologically under-stimulated and under-developed. For these students, a lot of scaffolding is important. I cannot simply put a grade-level text and a bunch of multiple choice questions in front of them and hope for the best, or ask them to read independently and shrug if they fall behind. That only works if they value education and are intrinsically motivated themselves. If they don't... well god forbid they appear to have fun in class, or that I spend a necessary amount of time getting them to buy into what I'm teaching so that it actually sticks, or that I give them a little agency so that they are treated like human beings for a while and practice making decisions about their learning. This is exactly what all the relevant experts and sources that I trust say I need to do, but the bureaucracy of child-hating psychopaths is not into it. They have the fewest complaints when what I'm doing looks like test-prep, which let's be honest bores the shit out of me and you, so definitely bores the shit out of my struggling students.

Not all my students are far below grade level. Some of them are at or above grade level. At some of the more highly-regarded schools in my district, their mastery would probably be seen as mediocre. However, relative to other students at my school, these guys are doing their best to aim high. In this group of students, I have students who have unbelievably bad situations at home and have to struggle with difficult family conflicts. They are emotionally affected by these things. Some of them struggle to be motivated. They might be the first English-speaking generation in their family. There are so many students that are driven and gifted. They go through the year barely turning any work in, and then BOOM they turn in something that demonstrates an impressive level of insight and creativity, maybe because they happened to have a good week and were better able to rise to their potential. They would soar so high if we only took notice and helped them overcome the obstacles that are holding them back.

Being responsive to the needs of either of these groups of students, which both make up the majority of my students, is not an important part of teaching according to the useless wastes of public money that have the most influence over what happens to them. When I try to do something to be responsive to my students according to best practices that I can cite, I tend to get reprimanded, called ""outside of the box"" for playing it safe according to science, get called ""rogue"" for letting my relationship with my students and all the data I get from that inform my teaching.

I have never felt as disrespected, demeaned, demoralized as a professional. I have never worked for people so ignorant. Their incessant demands for compliance with their unclear and contradicting instructions (how do you comply successfully with something that contradicts itself, anyway?) are oppressive and just wrong. They are so short on teachers, but I don't think they got the memo on that because they treat us like we are expendable. I already have another career and I am testing the waters through a TFA commitment... why the hell would I want to actually continue working under these conditions? 

If someone paid me to organize AGAINST this bureaucracy of clowns and identify them as the enemy of the people that they are I would take that job.",TeacherReality

1676670729.0,I made my VP cry today,"TLDR: I brought an error to the VPs attention and she responded by not fixing it and crying. 


In my district to handle sub/teacher shortages, teachers cover for absent teachers during their prep periods. We are supposed to have a union negotiated equitable rotation of teachers covering. My school in particular is terrible at it. People on the “leadership” team (deans, counselors, coaches, the vice principal and the principal) and school darlings rarely if ever are covering. 

Recently I complained that the space I’m reaching out of (I am a special education teacher, the only one in my building without their own class room) is being misused and it has become super disruptive to my students.

Since then, I have been covering almost every day and had three prep periods I wasn’t covering during in the past two weeks. 

Yesterday morning when I saw I was covering again, I asked the VP (who as part of her duties is supposed to create these schedules) why I had another coverage as it doesn’t make sense given the rotation. She responded that because of call outs EVERYONE was being used. Looking at the coverage sheet, this was obviously untrue but I let it go because I had stuff to do and I’m not interested in arguing with her.

Today, I sat in my car waiting for the daily coverage schedule to come in through email before going in. When I got it and saw I had lost my prep period again, I checked and made sure there were other people on the same rotation as me available. I already knew from checking yesterday that they should have been ahead of me in the rotation. None of them were covering, none of them had scheduling conflicts. There was no obvious reason it should have been me again. 

So armed with all this, I walked into the building and attempted to talk to my vice principal. I am NOT a confrontational person, and honestly part of why I’m dealing with not having a classroom and being used for coverages so much is because I am a very easy going person at work(I’ve learned my lesson now though). 

So I calmly tell my vice principal “VP, I covered 2nd grade Tuesday, 8th grade yesterday and you have me on the schedule for Kindergarten today. There are other sped teachers who have not had coverages at all this week.” (I had the ok to mention this from these teachers because everyone is aware of this issue and I’ve had all their backs before) 

And my vice principal starts crying and says “I’m sick and I’m here! And principal has said she will pay someone else to make the coverage schedule because I don’t want to do it anymore!” 

She wasn’t yelling but was loud, everyone is looking at us, I didn’t want to lose my shit so I just turned around and walked out of the office. I heard she starting crying more after I left and said “all the sped teachers hate me”

The absolute insanity of this situation is too much. Imagine someone bringing an error you made to your attention and responding by crying and telling them your job is too hard? I still lost my prep. She hasn’t said anything to me since. I’ve interacted with the principal since then and other leadership people who were there and everything was fine.

Idk what I want to do from here. I did talk to my union rep about it, they said they would address it but i am seriously just mind blown by the whole situation.",TeacherReality

Yes, asking about tattoos didn't occur to me as I never had to cover them before, my parents are teachers and covered in tattoo, it didn't even cross my mind. I also had a 1h phone chat with HR prior to my hiring and we talked, again, about teacher dress code extensively, tattoos were still not brought up. I feel deceited. 

I just started a new position as an ELA teacher in a charter (secular) middle school. The position has been vacant for nearly 2 years. I am highly qualified and they absolutely love me, they were desperate to hire me and paid my buyout for leaving my previous school.

Today a colleague, who also has a lot of tattoos, told, very nicely, me to cover up my arm tattoo, that it was against school policy.

I was told about dress code, which is slightly stricter than what I am used to, but I have no issues with it. I talked to HR for weeks (it was hard to break my old contract) never the tattoos were mentioned, and I have tattoos on my fingers! Idk if they were completely oblivious to them...

Should I pretend I don't know the rule? Also if I am told to cover them, which is ridiculous, none of my tattoos are offensive, the finger ones are a moon and a sun, the arm one is our local skyline, and the ones that will become visible in the summer are flowers, should I really cover them?

I live in Southern AZ and in August it can be over 115 degrees, I absolutely cannot teach in long sleeves!! And I will probably start coaching soccer, outdoors. 

What are they going to do? Fire a good teacher they had trouble finding and leave the classroom empty until they find replacement again? I'm the only ELA teacher of the entire school.

Everything in her life was going well— she had a boyfriend who she communicated with very often. Donna Barber’s boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, was an inmate at the local prison. 

Donna Barber and her boyfriend, Lawrence Ray, would often video chat. By the way——-their video chats were steamy. On some occasions, Donna Barber would remove her clothes and participate in explicit conversations while on the job.

Once again, Donna Barber worked in a school with children. I’m not quite sure about the specific age or grade level. However, the inappropriate acts and verbal exchange in the workplace is off limits especially a school setting. 

Since, Lawrence Ray was an inmate he was breaking the rules, too. There’s strict rules that he disobeyed during their frequent calls.

Also, Donna Barber’s actions weren’t criminal as mentioned by the local state attorney. But….. the Franklin County School District began to investigate where her calls took place and the timing which were during school sessions.

According to the online records, Donna Barber was told that the school board would recommend termination. Since, her video chats were leaked to the public-she swiftly resigned. She nearly had a great retirement with pension and full benefits.

1674585850.0,Vent RE reference,"Just have to quickly vent that the first AP I emailed about writing me a reference turned me down. I was an ESL teacher at several inner city Title 1 schools for 3 years. I had to leave over a year ago when my parents were both facing life -threatening health problems, multiple heart attacks and Covid. (I had requested unpaid leave, 4 times, FMLA and board approved, but our system was so overwhelmed that nothing was ever processed, so eventually I had no choice but to resign.)

The nature of being a floater doing pull-out at multiple schools means no one is in a great position to write you a reference.

However, the AP in question was the most recent to observe me and gave me a satisfactory review.

I also spent many extra hours per day at the start of the pandemic helping her contact all families about devices and WiFi hotspots and update complex excel charts for her supervisors and so on. Unpaid, of course, just an extra admin duty I agreed to help with.

I just can’t believe that after all the blood, sweat, and tears I put into that job, plus spending hundreds if not thousands of my own money in supplies, that she can’t cough up a generic reference!

I loved the kids, but I’m regretting ever going above and beyond at that job. It nearly destroyed my health. So glad to be free.., but I need references to get back into teaching, and it would be nice if my admin would step up just a bit!

Anyone else in this boat??

1674102926.0,A student stole $40 from me 6 weeks ago. Shouldn’t the school reimburse me?,"It’s not even a question that he stole it. I had three twenties folded together in my pocket, and when I took my keys out, they dropped on the floor. As I was bending over to pick them up, the student I was talking to (14) bent over to pick them up first. I thought, “That’s awfully nice of him, picking up something for a man in his 50s!” But, no. He goes, “Finder’s keepers!” then walked out into the hall. 

I said, “Ha, ha. Very funny. Please give me back my money,” but he only handed me $20. I said, “What about the other $40?” He said there wasn’t any more, then turned around and put the $40 in his underwear. Because he had gone into the hall, we got very clear security footage of him doing that, so the dean, my boss and I got his mom on speaker and we all pleaded with him to hand it over. He refused. After about 10 minutes, I went back to class because I had work to do. As I was leaving, my boss said, “Sorry that happened to you.”

They suspended him for the remaining two hours of the day, but he refused to leave, meaning he got to spend the day in the building without going to class, which is what he does all the time, anyway. So, essentially he faced no consequence. During that time, he admitted to the dean that he stole it but couldn’t give it back because he “lost” it.

At his re-entry meeting, we again tried and failed to get my money back. He says his mom told him she would have done the same thing which I totally believe because I never even got an apology from her, much less the money her kid stole. The dean has been advocating for me to get reimbursed but gotten nowhere. I also asked the principal and didn’t even get a response. 

So, I put in my two weeks. I don’t have another job lined up and probably won’t go back into education, but fuck that. Seventeen years experience as a special ed teacher, an MA, and certifications in ELA and Social Studies / History, but they’re willing to throw that away for $40. I guess a job requirement for teaching now is a willingness to be robbed? I also just can’t teach this child any more because every time he wants something from me, all I can think is, “Oh, you want a pencil? Use the $40 you stole from me to buy a whole box.”",TeacherReality

They also ignore IEP's and refuse to provide paras, which when they exist are paid $25,000. 

This, of course would be possible if $ was spent on lots of Teacherpayteacher worksheets, or if the teachers were professors at top schools with lots of money and help from interns. When I tweeted to the superintendent that he should rethink this issue, I was blocked from his official account.

1673817358.0,feeling horribly guilty for leaving my current school for another one,"I'm currently working for an alternative high school for at risk students. I want to leave because of ridiculous expectations from the corporates and the lack of community/spirit (I like most of my colleagues, but they are definitely not my friends and some colleagues really do make my days difficult). I am underpaid for my qualifications, our health plan is a patchwork of ridiculous plans that no doctor ever understands so I spend ALL of my lunch breaks on the phone with various providers to try to get simple doctor's visits covered. I have no retirement plan and I just arrived to the US with no saving and no plan for retirement. I keep getting undermined by corporates, colleagues can't put on their left sock on without me despite their seniority in the school (I've only been with them for a year and a half), more and more busy work with no real goal or growth out of them. Because of low enrollment I am incredibly bored. We also only have winter break, no fall or spring break. They often give holidays to the kids but make us come to school all day to ""plan"". No team building, we don't even have a break room, just. Meeting room with no window that happens to have a fridge and microwave. I spend my lunch breaks in my car!

So I have so many reasons to leave. But I feel so guilty, and I'll miss my students so much, because I do really love my students, they are the best part of the job. I feel guilty I am leaving a school that currently can't function without me. But at the same time I'm going to a school that needs me even more!

The new school has teachers my own age, happy students, spirit and community. It has a retirement plan and a real health insurance to offer as well as gas stipends, and more pay. AND I'll be able to put my daughter in pre-k there which will save me at least 10k!!!!! My days will be shorter. At the moment I only get 20min a day with my daughter, in the new school I would get an entire afternoon with her nearly everyday. And I can tutor for $25/h whenever I want which is really nice and I would still be home earlier than I am now.

So many reasons to be happy, and leave my current school behind. But the amount of backlash I am about the receive when I announce my departure, I'm also not giving notice as I am in an at will state and the school will withhold my last paycheck according to my contract (f them I'm not going to work for free!) so I will literally be gone overnight. And the disappointment of my students who are fragile teenagers who look up to me and who I absolutely adore... Urgh

In my decade of education I have had students who have experienced essentially every type of trauma you can imagine. 1 of my elementary students was murdered by his mother’s boyfriend. A 9 year old committed suicide. And another drowned in his bathtub after being drugged by his mother and then left unattended. 

I was hospitalized twice for injuries inflicted on me by students. I was told by my principal that getting a concussion from being head butted by a student was a REASONABLE EXPECTATION of my job. 

I had a complete mental breakdown a few months ago. I went through a severe bout with anxiety and depression and had to choose between my well-being or this job.

And here’s the kicker- I gave this job everything I had until I completely fell apart. When I had to resign because my physical and mental health were at serious risk, my principal didn’t even bother to respond to my resignation and just sent out an email to the staff about the logistics of covering my caseload. We are all completely indispensable. 

I honestly can’t believe I got out. A huge weight has been lifted, and this is the happiest I’ve been in years. I’m back to being myself. I’m back to being fun and happy.

1673367862.0,How to maintain order in my classroom when there's no support from admin?,"I'll be honest, guys.  I'm trying to leave this profession as quickly as possible.  I'm miserable.  My (middle) school is in complete disarray after a series of scandals, firings, quittings, and restructuring.  I won't get into it all here, but the result is that we're overcrowded, understaffed, dealing with an inexperienced new admin staff who create insane policies, and pure chaos from the students: daily fights, drugs, sex acts, etc. In the meantime, until I can make the switch, I'm just trying to survive.

The two biggest problems are lack of motivation/work completion and behaviors.  The first problem can be traced to a lot of things like COVID and lower standards, but perhaps the greatest cause is our school-wide policy of having to accept late work with no penalty until the end of the quarter.  I just had a student, who for the past quarter has screwed around and turned in nothing, email me a list of 10 assignments she completed, which I am forced to accept, and her grade went from a D- to a B+.  This leads to my nearly 200 students all being able to treat the entire school day as free time, then put in maybe 4 hours of effort at the end of the quarter and pass.

The second problem is bolstered by the first as well as other factors, but the result is that our admin is so overwhelmed dealing with high profile incidents, that absolutely nothing happens when a student has a minor infraction.  Dress code, talking over the teacher, food, cell phones, and games in class.  I could spend my entire day writing referrals (we don't have the authority as teachers to administer any other consequence such as a detention), but most of these referrals are ignored by admin or result in a quick 2-minute office lecture and then back to class.  Those who return to class stride in triumphantly and are admired by their peers.  Students show each other their behavior logs as a badge of honor.

What I'm left with is 6 periods a day, each over 30 students, who ignore everything I say, talk non-stop, get up and move around the room at will, sitting wherever they want, texting, throwing things, hitting each other, screaming, and me, trying hard to pretend that anyone is listening to me talk about metamorphic rocks.  Verbal warnings do nothing. Yelling does nothing. Writing kids up only encourages them.  When a parent finally concerns themselves with a student's grade, I get an email from said student listing all the assignments I should have forgotten about month's ago that I now have to spend time searching for online and grade.

What can I do to weather this storm until I can get out?  Is there any hope of having an effective seating chart and keeping kids in their assigned seats? Once again, I've spent hours upon hours writing behavior logs and referrals and speaking to admin about the problems with no success.  What can I do on my own, when there are no policies in place to support me, so that I don't feel like a prison guard who's just trying keep students' hands off each other and maintain my sanity.

I have a newish student who has been with me for a month. He is in my “reminder” category; he’s never had an accident and he will go, if needed, when I ask. 

Our sessions are 3 hours long, and I do “potty time” during centers, which is about halfway through our session. 

I asked this student if he needed to use the bathroom, and he said, “no.” Okay. 

30 minutes later, we do our second circle. He was dry at this time. 
Second circle is 20 minutes long, and parents pick up at the end. 

His mom was 10 minutes late. A few minutes later, she violently knocks on my door. When I opened it, she yelled at me because he was “soaking wet.” I told he that he was dry when circle started, and she asked how long ago that was (at this time, 30 minutes). 

Then she yelled that if it ever happens again, he won’t be coming back, and stomped away.

Over the the last two years 16 people have either quit or transferred. Her and I got into a disagreement a few weeks ago due to the way she spoke to me in front of some kids and since then she has not liked me. Anyway, I was hired to be an EA in a resource room, due to the obvious nature of the job, before and during my interview (and several times after) I disclosed how I do not feel comfortable working with children who have some form of autistic spectrum disorder, of course it has nothing to do with a prejudice of any kind, just knowing myself I do not work well with individuals such as that. I was told it wouldn’t be a problem and my place in the resource room would center around some of the kids who struggle behaviorally. Well there is a child with autism who is on the case load and he requires an aid with him, the aid he originally had continuously called off and administration would have me to be his one-on-one aid. I reminded them of my disclosure but helped anyway because I am a team player. Two weeks ago they fired his aid and I agreed to help until the board could approve a new hire to take over. Last week they told the intervention specialist they were changing the way her room was ran, hiring a new EA to help her and changed my schedule to be his full time aid without talking to me at all.

Educators will be holding rallies on Saturday, first at 1 p.m. at Haverhill City Hall and then at 4 p.m. at Malden City Hall.

The HEA and MEA released the following joint statement:

“It is no coincidence that the educators in both Haverhill and Malden took votes today to authorize strikes if their respective contracts are not settled before Monday. Several unions representing thousands of educators in communities north of Boston meet regularly to discuss our working conditions, which are our students’ learning conditions. The educators in Haverhill and Malden have been working without contracts. The respective unions have made numerous proposals to address staffing shortages, racial and social justice, safety in schools, adequate time for educators to prepare and collaborate, and wages that have been chronically suppressed. The school committees in both communities are showing no interest in addressing needs we see as critical to our students’ success.

“We are saying enough is enough. Our students deserve better, our communities deserve better, and we deserve better.

“We acknowledge the disruption our strikes can cause. But we can no longer in good conscience see our students receive less than they deserve and for educators to be continually disrespected as professionals. We are ready to bargain any time to settle these contracts. Our respective school committees have the power and authority to avert these actions.”",TeacherReality
1665643908.0,Needing some advice and a rant,"Hi guys. Discovering this subreddit has been therapeutic.

I’m a first year ECT and 5 weeks in I already feel like I’m sinking. The school I’m at has a very intensive marking policy. All books marked and an assessment competed, marked and feedback given every three weeks (so twice a half term). Ive got 10 class groups so you can do the maths here…I’ve been staying up until 11 o clock two or three weeknights every week trying to get through it and I’m already not staying ahead. I got quite sick last week, and although the change of weather of course played a part I also think it was spurred on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. 

Yesterday I got pulled in by a member of SLT as a complaint that I hadn’t marked one of my student’s books. I had already marked that class’s books but the student but have been absent when I took them up. Half way through the conversation I felt like I couldn’t even hear what they were saying to me and I had a really strong urge to just leave the building.

I feel like I’ve already checked out mentally and I don’t want to stay in this job. I know it’s really bad to leave a teaching position mid year, but I truly think I could see myself having a breakdown if I stay.

If I left, I was thinking I could do supply work until my lease is up on my apartment. Or even just find work in a cafe.

1665355055.0,"Going on my second year, and I’m feeling overwhelmed to the breaking point.","Hello all,

This is going to be my second year of teaching, and I just don’t know how to handle all of what is being piled onto my plate. I know this is what I signed up for, but I’m starting to feel depressed and hopeless. I’m not looking for any advice, I just want to let out what I’ve been holding in for some time.

For a little background, I started off teaching at am elementary school near the city, and I ended up having to quit mid-year right before Christmas break because I couldn’t handle teaching at that particular school anymore. I loved my kids, but I had two that needed a lot of extra supports due to special needs and behaviors that I couldn’t provide, and neither had a para to help them while I taught. I ended up getting assaulted by one of my more challenging students, and my cries for help fell on deaf ears, so I left. It was so bad there that I ended up being on a heart monitor because I was so stressed.

I’m at a better school now, but because I left halfway through, I’m behind on mandatory LETRS training, and I feel like the pressure keeps building every single day. Every week something new is piled onto our plates and no one asks “What can we do to help you?” Or asks what they can take away from us. I spend my one hour of planning during the day grading and talking to parents and lesson planning, but more often than not I’ll have to stop because we have ten other different self-directed PDs to complete by a certain deadline. Not to mention we have an entirely new curriculum, are fumbling through it at best, and are of course dealing with behaviors that have only worsened since the pandemic. I know this is common, but I feel so burnt out and alone. I try my best to create boundaries so that I don’t work at home or on weekends, but that means I’ll be at the school until five or six. 

I just feel like breaking down and crying. I feel like I can’t even give my loved ones any attention because of my job. My boyfriend lives in another state and we are both so tired we hardly have but one call a week, I haven’t seen any of my friends in months, and my cat that I’ve had for 14 years has cancer and is dying and I feel like I don’t even have the time or energy to sit with my sadness about that. I also have lost all ability to organize and be productive. My memory gets worse and worse each day and I feel like an idiot when I forget due dates and deadlines. I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD but it is taking forever to find a doctor who will actually get me the help I need, and I feel desperate.

My plate is broken. It can’t hold anything. I want nothing more than to just teach and love my kids, but inside I feel like the whole world is caving in on me. I’m trying my best every day, but sometimes my best is just getting out of bed every morning.",TeacherReality

1664899844.0,I thought I had a great job at a great school until..,"So, I posted this as a comment to somebody’s post about admin treating them poorly but I’ve wanted to make it into a post as I’m still having trouble making sense of what happened. 

I am an educator who’s been in the field for over ten years. I’m currently getting my MA in Early Childhood Education, as this is what I teach in. I’ve been teaching preschool for the past five years and have been working at one school in particular. Last year, my supervisor left and I was asked to step up in her place. I had no prior training or experience running a preschool but I worked tirelessly with my admin day in and day out to create curriculum, build a community, maintain safety in the classrooms, and make sure the kids were well taken care of. I had built great relationships with families over the years and taught their children as well as the siblings. I was teaching a preschool 3s class and I even had a parent call to make sure I would be teaching it the following school year (this year). Since that was my class, I told her yes and she gladly told other parents who then enrolled their kids to stay in the program and continue in my class. 

During the school year I had a lot of problems with staff because most of the teachers I worked with were not teachers but more so looking for part time gigs. I heard a lot of, “well I don’t get paid enough for this shit” or “this is toddler school so it means nothing.” I also had issues with asking them to sanitize during a freakin pandemic. You would have thought I was the supervisor from hell if you asked them but I was the first director of that school that never made teachers feel guilty for calling out and told them they needed to put themselves first. I treated them like humans. I worked very closely with a teacher who was my assistant one year and then became my second in command once I stepped up. We had a great relationship until we learned she had been lying about being in grad school. Not only was this against the law, and her contract, but management didn’t want to get rid of her mid year in fear of the parents reactions.  As the months went on the lies piled up. From little white lies about prepping materials to lying about things such as being pregnant and getting surgery. I felt she was a liability but nobody took me seriously.

After such a trying and mentally exhausting year, I decided to take the summer off and return in the fall. I work at a private school so summers were not paid but you could work at the camp there. Anyways, as I was preparing to go back to the classroom, it was decided that somebody who was more qualified to be director would take over my responsibilities, and being in grad school at the time, I was ok with this. My management told me I should be focusing on grad school, which they were paying for and said I needed my masters in order to grow there. 

Fast forward to the end of summer, I tell them I got approved for student teaching and would be out of the classroom one day a week in a school my grad school placed me in. It was not up to me and I couldn’t do it at my work site. 
Once that was said, they told me I “wouldn’t be happy returning” and that they needed someone full time in the classroom even though it would only be for one semester AND they would have the staff to cover the one three hour shift a week when I wasn’t there. I figured out that once they realized they could use my salary to hire more shitty teachers as bodies, they decided they didn’t need me anymore. I rarely pat myself on the back but I did everything for them and I was honestly a model teacher. Even when parents called them angrily after hearing I wasn’t returning, they still didn’t seem to budge. 

All I wanted was to continue teaching the 3s class and as an even bigger slap in the face, they ended up giving my class to the teacher that had been lying to everyone all year. 

Basically, I’m writing this because I’ve been losing sleep over it and I’m so angry at them for kicking me to the curb. I did EVERYTHING for them. I kept a school open during Covid. I wrote their entire curriculum. I stayed up late at night with my Cricut machine making stickers and prepping activities for my kids on the regular. I built incredible relationships with families, but, I guess it wasn’t good enough? I’m still in grad school but now I’m second guessing everything. Do I even want to do this anymore? Am I a good enough teacher? I still feel so broken about it and it’s been a month now. 

Truly, I’d love to enter the field of education policy one day so I can work for the true MVPs, the mother fucking teachers. We deserve more than management could ever understand and it’s just..

So. 
Damn. 
Frustrating.

Teachers had to come to school masked while students roamed freely maskless. Our COVID sick days were reduced to 5 per year. I took medical leave for 2 weeks and ended up losing over half my monthly paycheck because the rate to pay subs is higher than my daily rate.  Had a high school kid threaten to shoot up the school during my class. Kid is returned to my class weeks later. I had no explanation of what happened during that time. Same year had a 4 hour bomb threat lockdown where students were peeing in buckets and other containers bc we couldn’t go in the hall. Thanks to tik tok, Kids were vandalizing bathrooms so most bathrooms were locked up, causing students to need to miss class for 15 min just to find the nearest bathroom. Also thanks to tik tok, it was a trend to sexually assault your teacher by smacking them on the butt. A parent wanted to interview me for what I was teaching for the ENTIRE YEAR and I was required to attend that interview. We were asked to do janitorial duties because janitors were asked to work holidays for $11/hour and so they all quit. I teach ceramics and the room lacked safe ventilation. I didn’t have my own classroom, or an office for planning and it’s kind of necessary when your an art teacher to prep materials in the room you teach in. I have a masters with 8 years of certification and was being paid less than 55k per year in one of the most expensive cities in the USA. With health insurance and everything else deducted, I was barely taking home 3500 per month. What makes this worse is that teachers are bound to an annual contract that only benefits school districts (did you know they can just move you to another school at will if they choose? Or make you teach at two schools in one day so you have to travel for lunch?) They try to make it seem like breaking a contract will ruin your career and teachers do buy into this myth.  I left teaching that year to work remote in tech in an entry level job and already get paid more after 4 months of being here.

The pay scale for SPS teachers, which depends on tenure and educational attainment, ranges from roughly $60,000 to $123,500 annually for 7.5-hour workdays (37.5-hour workweeks) and a shorter working year than people in the private sector typically endure. That's not including pension benefits, which can be quite generous depending on the number of years teachers log in the system. They should see what LA Teachers make it's insane.

Sure, there's always current material to relate, but that isn't the point.  Do kids even read books anymore?  Should I assign worksheets and outlines, or short videos to watch instead?

Im an introvert with social anxiety and i feel like my job takes up all of my energy, it is exhausting. Dont get me wrong, i love my kids and i dont feel anxious when im in front of the classroom teaching idk why. When i get home from work, i rest for abit and then do more work to prepare for work the next day. I hate this about the job, its like endless work. Maybe if i stick to teaching at the same school it will get better?

I also feel like im teaching kids to constantly conform to rules and not question them (how to sit or speak or behave or dress or write). Its like teaching a bunch of unique individuals to act or think the same way. Idk if im overthinking this, i jst feel like im shaping these kids to be part of the machine. The kids who question the system or the rules are considered “naughty” or “disrepsectful” and must be punished. If they dont write their essay in the structure that was taught, they wont do well.

I was let go that same year because I “wasn’t doing enough” according to admin. I was upset at their reasoning but felt relief as I didn’t love teaching anyway.

I decided to take the following year off of teaching and started to look for other jobs. I have a very specialist degree and two very specialist credentials. From September to May of last year I applied to hundreds of jobs for onboarding or HR and never even got an interview. I was an emotional wreck at this point and gave in and applied to one of the better private schools for the subject I teach. 

I got the offer and accepted it. I was so excited to be done job searching. As the start of the school year has gotten closer I’m DREADING the start of the school year. I hate teaching, I’m good at it and students like me but I absolutely hate it. On top of that the school pays so little I’ll be going negative about $1,000 a month.

He didn’t make his reasoning public, but I overheard him tell a custodian, “they sit in there and talk shit, they can go talk shit upstairs, I don’t have time for that.” 
Talking shit being, ‘they promised we’d have computers for students in September, it’s now March and we still don’t have anything,’ and ‘Principal cornered and verbally abused me today, here is how to protect yourself.’ We know our admin work hard and do what they can with what we have, but that doesn’t make our school not a shit-show.

***By  Zoe Yu***[ ](https://time.com/author/zoe-yu/)

***July 23, 2022 7:00 AM EDT***

***Yu is a rising high school senior and writer from Texas***

**On May 24, 19 students and two teachers were shot and killed at** [**Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas**](https://time.com/6181501/texas-school-shooting-victims-uvalde/)**—the   deadliest mass shooting in our state’s history. I remember staring at   my phone as the gut-wrenching headlines rolled in: fourth-grader** [**Miah Cerrillo**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/08/uvalde-congress-students-testify-gun-violence/) **had covered herself in her classmate’s blood to trick the shooter into thinking that she was already dead; teacher** [**Arnuflo Reyes**](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/us/uvalde-school-teacher-arnulfo-reyes-interview/index.html)**, who was shot in the arm and lung, lost 11 students in his class; and the body of 10-year-old** [**Maite Yuleana Rodriguez**](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/07/1103577387/matthew-mcconaughey-green-converse-shoes-sneakers-uvalde-maite-rodriguez) **was  so disfigured from the bullets that she could only be identified by   her lime-green Converse with a heart drawn on the right toe.  On the  news, the pictures of** [**grieving families**](https://time.com/6181718/uvalde-shooting-grieving-community/) **clinging  to one another, and of children climbing from windows and  sprinting  away from the school-turned-war zone with faces twisted in  shock and  confusion, were haunting. That same night, my friends and I  stayed up  late sharing articles and TikTok updates with the same  heaviness that  we’d felt after** [**Parkland**](https://time.com/6198426/parkland-shooting-sentencing-trial-day-one-recap/)**,** [**Santa Fe**](https://time.com/5282212/santa-fe-high-school-texas-school-shooting/)**, and** [**Oxford High**](https://time.com/6125256/michigan-school-shooting-covid/)**—now,   with the choking pain of another tragedy added to the list. It was the   dystopian familiarity of coming of age in the gun era.**

**When  I arrived at my Texas high school the next day, an administrator  was  standing at the door with a cart full of confiscated items. Of  course,  there were backpacks, which were never allowed during finals  week, but I  was surprised to see smaller bags, too—brown paper lunches,   end-of-the-year gifts for teachers—that my school had never taken up   before. Right before I could enter the building, the administrator   pointed at my laptop bag. “With what happened yesterday,” she explained   in an apologetic whisper, “we’re just on edge.”**

**I  handed over my bag without a second thought because I knew exactly how   my administrator was feeling. Like most American schools, we stop   breathing over Snapchat threats and warning messages posted to   Instagram. It’s only when the kid is caught with a gun in their pants   that we can breathe easy again, our grim relief that no one was hurt   outweighing the terror of what might have been. Because they could’ve   pulled the trigger, we face active-shooter drills that eat up entire   class periods and get trained to leave the door locked at all times, no   matter who’s begging to be let in—a peer, a principal, a best friend.   Sometimes, we even analyze hiding spots or plan for what to do if we’re   in the hallways, bathrooms, staircases, or cafeteria when the gunfire   starts, despite knowing, deep down, that nothing can really prepare us   for a moment like staring down the barrel of an assault rifle.**

**And with every school shooting—**[**27 so far, in 2022 alone**](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01)**—our fears gain legitimacy. It’s why lawmakers** [**are rallying around more armed on-campus officers**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/24/texas-republicans-uvalde-gun-control/) **and extra security checkpoints, and why Texas Republican** [**Senator Ted Cruz** ](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/sen-ted-cruz-proposes-one-door-entry-at-tx-schools-safety-experts-say-its-not-feasible)**pitched the idea of “having one door that goes in and out of the school.” Other prominent figures like** [**former President Donald Trump**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/27/donald-trump-nra-houston/) **and** [**National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre**](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/nra-wayne-lapierre-cpac-gun-rights-school-safety/2016151/) **seem to be reading from the same teleprompter flashing the same incessant buzzword: just** [**“harden” the schools**](https://time.com/6187656/school-safety-mass-shootings/)**.**

**But   while I understand that the knee-jerk reaction to violence is a push   for stronger security, I can’t help but ask questions. Why did I have to   give up my laptop bag? Why was my administrator screening for threats   like she was a TSA officer or a prison warden instead of a school   staffer? And why was my school—an educational institution—shouldering   the responsibility of checking for weapons to keep students and staff   from being gunned down?**

**Most  of all, I’m stunned that the concept of hardening schools is even a   casual talking point. To me, it feels like an admission—that gun   violence is the new normal, that school shootings will inevitably happen   again, and that there’s nothing we can do but to brace ourselves for   the next bang.**

Forced to resign ourselves to   the constant fear that our hallways might one day turn into a shooting   range? And on top of creating lesson plans and grading assignments,  will  teachers be expected to fend off an armed gunman,** [**a feat that even trained law enforcement officers couldn’t manage in Uvalde**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/20/uvalde-police-shooting-response-records/)**?**

It shouldn’t have to be that way for  students to  be safe at school.**

# Staffing shortage leads to involuntary teacher transfers at Montgomery County schools

 

**by John Gonzalez**

**Thursday, July 21st 2022** 

&#x200B;

 **MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. (7News) — Several public school teachers in Montgomery County say their summer break is coming to an abrupt end.** 

**Officials  with Montgomery County Public Schools have sent out a long list of  involuntary teacher transfers -- Some teachers received calls from  principals while on vacation. The union says the school system has  violated its contract.**

 **At Sherwood High School, close to two dozen staff members have been  relocated to other schools or told they will move into other positions,  with very little notice. Teachers report back to schools in about a  month.**

**7News  obtained a copy of the MCPS teacher contract, and it clearly states,  that principals will notify employees who have been involuntarily  transferred no later than Monday, February 28, 2022, and will provide  the (MCEA) education association a list of unit members identified for  involuntary transfer by the third Friday in March.**

**Also in the  contract it says, every effort will be made to notify the unit member of  the need for an involuntary transfer prior to the job fairs.**

 **In order to fill major staff shortages in other schools and cover  budget downfalls, some school electives and courses such as ESOL,  Women’s Studies and Business classes have been drastically reduced or  dropped.**

**Some 9th and 10th-grade classrooms already have 33 to 35 kids, more students than most classrooms have desks.**

**The  most recent school year ended with 581 unfilled positions countywide.  Meanwhile, 973 teachers have indicated they will be resigning or  retiring -- Which means class sizes are bound to increase.**

 **The teacher’s union says this situation violates the teacher contract --  several employees are being involuntarily transferred, receiving  surprise emails this week while on summer break. The union says they  should have been notified at least five months ago.** 

 **MCPS teacher resignations and retirements are up 38% in the past school year.**

**There are currently about 400 open teaching positions.**

**7News reached out to the school district and they sent us the following statement:**

***“School  systems across the country and throughout the region are faced with  challenges concerning open positions. One way to ensure that schools  have the employees needed is to transfer from a school with a surplus to  a school with a deficit, doing so ensures that students have the  teachers, administrators and support professionals needed. We are  working vigorously to recruit for all of our open positions, we do this  throughout the school year and are doing so now so that we begin school  fully staffed.”***

1658544603.0,Former teacher says he earns higher pay as Walmart professional,"  

**By: Maia Belay,** [**Nexstar Media Wire**](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/?post_type=profile&p=7076) 

**Posted: Jul 21, 2022 / 10:37 AM CDT** 

**Updated: Jul 21, 2022 / 11:10 AM CDT** 

 

**CANTON, Ohio (**[**WJW**](https://fox8.com/news/former-teacher-says-he-earns-higher-pay-as-walmart-professional/)**) — A former teacher said he is making more money as a Walmart professional.**

**Seth Goshorn taught for nearly six years, including at an elementary  school in Canton, Ohio, before deciding to change careers. It’s a  decision he said that led to an increase in pay by about $20,000 after  factoring in bonuses.**

**Dressed in his new Walmart uniform, Goshorn recorded a TikTok  video acknowledging the dramatic pay gap. He said the video  unexpectedly went viral.**

**“I didn’t think it would be this good. I might get a couple hundred  likes, so just the fact that it blew up and I’ve only been on it for  like a year,” Goshorn said. “It was really cool to see just the power of  the internet.”**

**Goshorn, who has a degree in early childhood education, is now  working as a “Walmart coach” on the management track. More than one  month into his new job, he said the transition was smooth.**

 

**“Last year I made about $43K teaching, so not anything terrible, but it also still left a lot to be desired,” said Goshorn.**



**He said he loved his time as a teacher and made lifelong friendships  with families. However, he was searching for a job that would better fit  his financial needs while planning an upcoming wedding with his  fiancée.** 

**Goshorn said working at Walmart provides professional growth without requiring a second degree.** 

**“My degree doesn’t exactly translate but the skills that a lot of  teachers have and the leadership ability teachers have does correlate to  a lot of companies,” he said. “So, find a company that’s willing to  train you for a position that might pay better.”**

**Goshorn does not discourage anyone from becoming a teacher and said  educators need additional support through increased salaries.**

&#x200B;

 **“Even though they’re scheduled for 40 hours, they’re working a lot  more than that, whether it’s teaching, grading after school,” Goshorn  said. “I coached football and track so those were other things on the  weekends. I did summer school. We don’t have all the time off that they  think.”**

**According to data referred to by the Ohio Department of Education,  the median teacher assignment salary statewide is $64,427. Salaries can  vary widely depending on which county and what school district a teacher  works in.** 

**Goshorn said he hopes his story serves as a teaching moment about the  power of the career pivot and the importance of supporting teachers.** 

**“I’m going to be a lifelong teacher,” he said. “That will always be a  part of my life, whether it’s at Walmart or on social media.”**

I taught for three years before becoming a full time technologist, and I'd heard some pretty wild stories back then. This app was inspired by one story in particular, where a female teacher friend of mine had to try to break up a fight during class between two male high school juniors. Not an ideal scenario. It would have been awesome to have a quick, discreet way to call for help.

In light of what happened in Uvalde and the lack of anybody doing anything about it, I'm releasing Little Red Button completely free and full featured (more features will be coming in the future).

Today she was lashing out and crying, screaming, and throwing things because we were moving on to something she didn't want to do. I was able to calm her down enough that she stopped crying, picked up her mess, and sat in her seat. She then asks me if she can go the assistant principals office. I asked her why as she wasn't in trouble and she told me she wanted her prize. I asked her what prize she was talking about and she said ""my prize for crying."" It took everything in me to keep a straight face as I told her that we don't get prizes for crying, we get prizes for doing the right thing.

Of course, I'm appreciative of the help admin has been able to lend to me earlier this year, but now it's just teaching her that she gets rewarded for lashing out and misbehaving. Thank god this school year is almost over.",TeacherReality

 The principal was one of the those ""won't someone PLEASE think of the children!"" types who created a stifling, miserable environment by enacting draconian rules/guidelines that not only hurt staff but students too (e.g. requiring teachers to keep a violent child in their class and ""deal with it"" which not only was bad for the teacher, but created am unsafe space for the other kids).

I found this article problematic for a number of reasons.  The headline is misleading.  apparently Texas has been doing this for a long time.  no surprise here, I'm sure, but there are record numbers of teachers leaving their schools across the country.

We all know why.  It's different state to state. But it's really all the same.  In nc, gop legislator killed the teaching fellows program, a state program that covers higher education costs for people who teach.  They killed the pay increase for teachers when they get a masters.  And they adjusted the salary schedule to decrease pensions.  

Then nationally teachers are feeling the brunt of fairy tale propaganda around a ""liberal agenda"" and indictrination... district policies around covid they have no control of.  And then the difficulties in teaching during a pandemic when you're ""distance learning"" one week, face to face the next, and students and teachers both are in and out, quarantined for a week or two at a time.  

It's been rough.  

I have an msa.  Principals license in nc.  When I got the masters, I learned enough to know I'd never want the job of principal.  I just say that to vet my comment.

To be fired, teachers have to be given due process.  When they have tenure, they have a 4th(?) Amendment right to their job.  That's why it's hard to fire shitty teachers.  Side note: most important job of a principal is to make sure the adults in your school are good for kids.  Due process and documentation make it harder.  But that's the job.

I wonder if it could be argued that they have the same property right to their teaching license?  I know Texas legislators granted Texas state Ed dept authority to revoke licenses for leaving mid year.  But I sure as hell don't like that.  

The challenges teachers are facing right now are really hard.  But policies like this seem to place the blame of empty classrooms on teachers, penalizing them for giving up after having taken so much abuse that they just can't take it any more.

It's a job.  You can quit.  You shouldn't face prosecution for leaving a job.  Can you think of any other job where that hapens?

 Contract abandonment is a spin term.  Beginning teachers can be fired without due process when the district simply doesn't renew the contract.  So they get you coming and going.  

Sorry this is so long.  I'm sure nobody made it this far.  But wasn't it Arizona that brought in the national guard as warm bodies in classrooms? Texas is trying to stem the flow by MAKING them stay... at least til the end of the school year.  There is an exodus happening.  And I'm afraid that the  budgetary needs across the nation to fix the problems will be prohibitive.

1647692205.0,My contract wasn't renewed and I'm so devastated,"This happened on Wednesday and I am taking it so hard. I have worked at this school in 7th grade for 6 years now, 3 1/2 as a para and 2 1/2 as a special education teacher. I got my certification while working. My job is insanely hard but I work really hard and I make great connections with my students. There was never any indication given to me that I wasn't doing a good job. I never had a review (until Tuesday, after they already knew that I was being fired), there was never a conversation, I was given no chances to improve. My coworkers all support me and think that I do a good job. I know I'm still green but I really felt like I was hitting my stride this year and starting to get the hang of it. I even sent an email to my boss saying that, though she already knew I was being let go. 

On Wednesday I was called into a room (with a union rep thankfully) and told that my contract is not being renewed for next year, but they would hire me back on as a para. This is insulting because it is about a 40% paycut, there's no way I can live on that. No reason is given, and since it's been less than 5 years, I don't think they have to give me one. 

I don't bring this up to garner sympathy, but it's important for context. I found out in December that my mom had terminal cancer and that she would be starting chemo. I am super close to my mom and she lives near me, this was absolutely devastating news. I shared this with my principal because I (naively) trusted her. She acted sympathetic at the time. I have major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. All of that was in check until my mom got sick, then I really fell off the deep end. 

At the encouragement of my principal and others (I do recognize that ultimately it was my decision) I took 3 weeks of FMLA so I could pull myself together. I saw a psychiatrist, changed my meds, started making lifestyle changes, and when I returned to work I legitimately felt so much better, and I really started feeling much better about my work. 

As I said, I am too trusting and my principal is privy to a lot of my mental health struggles but I won't get into all of that. It is important to note though, that she knows things about me that others don't which is why I think it was the impetus for my firing. I think they think I'm a wreck and not worth the hassle, and don't want to be around for the fallout when my mom passes. 

No one owes me any favors because my mom is sick, but it seems so heartless and cruel, and personal. I was never put on an improvement plan and never once told that I wasn't doing something right. My school is very supportive and I reach out for help when I need it and I am constantly eager for feedback on how to improve. I'm friends with everyone in the school, I'm friendly and well liked, and now I have to say goodbye to all these people I have worked with for 6 years. 

I also have to finish out the year, so I am reminded constantly of the pain and betrayal. I have to play it straight too because I can't get ""fired"" fired. I am hurting so bad, I feel like I'll always question other's kindness now, as I feel that is ultimately what cost me my job. Special ed is in high demand and I'm a HQT for middle school ELA, so I think I'll find a job, but it doesn't make this feel any better. Sorry this was so long, it weighs on my mind a lot.

Yesterday, I got a pretty terrific curriculum development offer. I wanted to share what worked for me, in case it’s helpful for any other soon-to-be-former teachers. 

-When it became clear that I needed to leave teaching, I started monitoring job boards for edtech and curriculum roles. 

-However, what I found more helpful was going to the individual websites for the different curriculum companies, professional development orgs etc that I’ve come to know over the years. I made a spreadsheet with the direct links to the relevant career page for each organization, so it would be easier to keep tabs on all of them quickly. 

-Here’s where luck somewhat took over. (I’m still trying to give myself credit. [ya know, imposter syndrome] but really, this was a lot of luck.)There was a posting for *three* openings in one of my specialty areas at a curriculum organization that I’ve know for years and have grown to deeply admire. 

-I applied, and then reached out to someone I sort of knew at the organization. This person was a lead curriculum designer for another content area, but I had a feeling he might be connected to this project too. I sent him an email saying basically, “You might remember me from xyz school, now I am very I interested in joining the abc team.” And he wrote back saying that he is actually the lead for the abc team had been pleased to see my application— score!

-From there, they had me do a take home assignment and a panel interview. And yesterday, they offered me the job!

-The downside is that it’s about a $10k paycut. I live in a very HCOL area, so my teacher salary was higher than average. However, the job is remote and the hours seem very reasonable. For me, the trade off is worth it.

1645965880.0,I never thought I’d leave my school,"I’m an elementary teacher and have been at my school for the better part of a decade. This is my first and only school I’ve taught at for my entire career. We have a reputation for taking students who have been removed from other schools. I’ve had the INCREDIBLE opportunity to watch my kids grow and I’m excited to see who they will become.

However. 

It has now gotten to a point where there are so many escalations and disregulated students harming others (bullying, fighting, online harassment, and just straight up not letting anyone teach by yelling out and screaming at teachers) and I have no recourse aside from calling parents. Admin seem to be in survival mode and just want to keep people from physically hurting others until the end of the year. That’s it. I know they’re overwhelmed as well. But I’m tired of working three jobs and selling my plasma just to get by, only to be told by a ten year old that “I’m really starting to piss him off” just for having the audacity to ask him to stop talking during my class. Every day is constant arguing and struggle. I teach a specials class for gods sake (art, music, gym). We have fun! But the kids have been through so much in the past few years with quarantine and rough home lives; Everything has compounded and it just feels like the people above me have given up on them. I can’t care about the kids more than my superiors any more. I’m done working myself into the ground for this job that I found so rewarding before. 

It’s a real blow to the soul to see kids I love so much, and who have made so much damn progress, revert back to old behaviors and coping skills because we don’t have the resources and support to properly serve them. I feel like I’m killing myself for a goal that we all say we want, but the people calling the plays don’t or can’t care about the goal anymore.

EDIT: To clarify, THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE STUDENTS. They’re having to adjust to this crazy world in the midst of so much chaos. They’re doing their best with the few resources we’re giving them. I love my students dearly and it breaks my heart that we’re in this position.",TeacherReality
1645834206.0,Pain to Pay Ratio,"I got this idea from another thread, and I haven't been able to get it out of my head all day. They were talking about how their level of pain to level of pay was really good. Like, the job was pretty painless and paid well. 

I haven't been able to stop thinking about how painful this job is vs. the level of pay we get from it. I've often thought that I do so much great quality work, plan and teach my ass off, and I barely take breaks during the day...after 10 years, I feel like I'm working like a CEO but making a salary that's like an entry level position at a ""normal job."" 

The level of pain compared to the level of pay is untenable, and I am so sure of that these days.

1645493080.0,Mental Health Resources,"We all know the state of mental health in the educational system is a complete and total mess for most of us! I thought I would share two things that have kept me from a complete and total breakdown. In all honesty, I hope that this information is not new to anyone and that everyone who needs it already has access to it! In the event that is not the case here are two resources that I hope can help some of you out there. 
Many schools and unions provide an EAP (Employee Assistance Program) as part of their benefits.  An EAP is to help provide resources for employees in a variety of areas. It can be used by everyone in your household. They provide references for mental health professionals in your area and depending on your program the EAP pays for several appointments. (The programs I have used paid for between 3 and 6 appointments.) They also provide referrals for child care, legal advice, financial advice, life coaching, etc. It is also completely confidential; they legally cannot inform your employer you have even contacted them. You can call them several times. For example, if you called about a conflict with an administrator, you can get your free sessions. You can call again about an issue with a parent and get another set of sessions. Had a fight with your husband? Call and get another set of sessions. I have not found a limit to this yet. Remember, anyone in your household can use it as well. If your spouse is struggling, they can get free sessions. If you have a child that is struggling, they can get free sessions. 
The other resource that I have found very helpful is NAMI, National Alliance on Mental Illness. I just started to be familiar with this organization. Their website has a lot of really good information. In some areas, they have support groups for people with mental illness and for their families. They have a help line 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) that is available M-F 10AM-10PM. What I found most helpful is their text line, my breakdowns tend to be in the evenings or Sundays. They have trained crisis counselors that are available for free 24/7. All you have to do is text NAMI to 741741. It has been the extra support that I needed to be able to get to the next day. 
I hope no one needs it but I feel this is a case that there is not harm in repeating it and providing it to people who might already know it. If you would like to message me about any of this information feel free to message me.",TeacherReality
1645491280.0,Do the poor working conditions filter for a personality type?,"First of all, let me first say what a relief it is to find this sub. The working conditions in teaching are NOT normal or acceptable, and it's nice to find others who can say it openly.

Second of all, I'm going to be very direct and frank in the commentary I want to make. I'm sorry if I word things awkwardly, and if there's a better way to express something, I'd appreciate some correction from others here.

Third of all, I want to speak from my own experience teaching in higher education. I have not been a k-12 teacher, though my wife is in a private school. I've been a university lecturer and college adjunct professor in a few different contexts. 

The working conditions in US higher ed are laughably bad. I used to see comically over-the-top labor abuses within the University of California, and someone described to me (accurately, I think) working as a college adjunct as being ""basically an uber driver."" I got frustrated after 3 years of the nonsense, and took an entry-level job at a luxury hotel doing manual labor. I actually made more money there even though it was a minimum wage job I could've gotten in high school, but I digress.

BY FAR the most frustrating aspect of teaching in higher education was **the other people I worked with**. I would see (again) COMICALLY over-the-top labor abuses and bureaucratic dysfunction in, for example, the University of California, but the other people in my same precarious position would bend over backwards into their own assholes to defend the schools and programs, at times as if they were defending their own families. I knew for a fact that these other lecturers had no financial incentive, had no promise of more stable working conditions, and could sometimes be under even worse conditions than I was. And yet, they pushed back against any and all criticisms of the schools/curriculum, even outside of the school in our personal lives. 

When I took entry-level jobs in the private sector, I would see similar abuses and mismanagement. The major difference was that *the other people I was working with* would openly articulate, talk about, and acknowledge that wrong things were going on. They normally would NOT bend over to defend inappropriate management, or the money guzzlers at the top. It is honestly a breath of fresh air to speak to others who can state plainly what is right in front of our faces. 

I have no sympathy for the people who are in those shitty working conditions at the universities I worked in. These were the same people who would fight tooth and nail to the death to convince me that the schools NEEDED to treat us like garbage, and that's the way it has always been, and I need to change my attitude. 

But...where in the world does this obsequies sycophancy come from? I have this working theory that I'm hoping others can help me with. 

One of the jobs that I took after getting fed up with higher ed was as an enumerator with the 2020 US Census. My gig with the census may have the biggest shitshow I have ever been a part of, and it was truly an appropriate crescendo for the Trump administration to purposefully make it into a shitshow, as the president's 1 term in office was coming to an end. 

However, the best part of the job BY FAR was going on the r/Census subreddit and shit-talking the whole thing with other like-minded people. Others had even worse experiences in the Census than I had had, with stories about inappropriate supervisors, dangerous situations that the bureau refused to rectify, and (to top it all off) the failure of the federal department to issue W-2 forms once the thing was all over. 

Somewhere along the line, towards the end of Census operations in October, something changed on the subreddit. MASSIVE amounts of people quit their census jobs, and I can only guess that not long after they quit, they stopped participating in the census subreddit. That meant that by the end of operations, rational people had already been long filtered out, and only the goobers were left. I remember that I posted a thread about a negative personal experience I had while out in the field, and I would receive replies along the lines of, ""Well, that sounds like a you problem!"", or ""You need to act more professional as a Census enumerator!"" My posts earlier into census operations WOULD NOT have gotten such responses. 

Given that I love teaching, I'm really good at it (I've gotten nothing but top evaluations in university/college settings), and I feel like I work well with middle-school aged students, I've thought about pursuing a position as a middle school teacher in a public school. Of course, here in California I would need to pay $15k for the credential that would allow me to even apply to jobs, I hesitated, but what really turns me off is the thought of the absolute wieners I may need to work with. When it comes to teachers, I've seen many things: people with personality disorders, hormonal imbalances, abusers, or mood disorders who take out their mental illness on powerless teenage students, tenured teachers who teach their class by simply having students stare at a wall for 2 hours (I've mostly seen this one in math classes for some reason), and of course the English Language Arts idealists who wish they were Robin Williams's character in *The Dead Poet Society*. The idealists concern me the most, as I see them as working with fewer professional boundaries. 

Shit conditions create a toxic workplace, in which talented and caring teachers are filtered out and only the losers are left. 

I want to leave, but then I think...my own kids are going to need to be taught in these failing systems someday. They will need to suck up to the abusive teachers with mood disorders or hormonal imbalances, and their future will depend upon their ability to get subjectively awarded letter grades from people who are lucky to have found a position paying them $40k per year. 

Am I on to something here? US schools seem to be a work environment that demands conformity to loser behaviors...right?",TeacherReality

I have been worried lately about the troubling signs of the death of our public school system. Whether it's the conservative bills aimed at teachers curriculums, or the hateful rhetoric being thrown at teachers and their unions, I can't help but feel like America is on its way to privatizing the school system entirely, which terrifies me. I fear for the families that rely on public education for their children's schooling, and that would most likely be unable to afford a private education for their children. I'm also worried, that some of the loudest voices against teachers and public schools are also some of the people who would be impacted the most by the end of public schooling in America.

So, I wanted to ask the people and teachers here some questions. I will put them in a list below:
1.) Are you worried about the death of public schools in America?
2.) If public school ends, what do you think the new system will look like?
3.) Do you believe education will still be a requirement for families, one that is punishable by law if they choose not to have their children go to school/can't afford it?
4.) Do you believe education is a right? Or is it a privilege?
5.) How do you feel the end of public schools will affect the country (if it happens)?

I want to assure you we are going to work to make this community better. We want a community that is inclusive of everyone who enters into it with good intentions. This was meant to be a sub that offered the public an understanding of the daily experience of teachers and guidance to teachers who, unfortunately, felt they could not continue in the profession. It was meant as a place to improve education, not disparage it or the professionals that put in the hard work every day to improve the lives of their students.

Teaching can be hard. I have been an educator for 16 years. I have attended my students' funerals. I have made the calls to CPS. I have been helpless to stop things I knew were wrong. That does not change my unwavering faith that the work we do is just and right. 

I want this work to be more sustainable. I'm tired of watching young teachers burn out. That is why we are here-- to offer care and support.

I have to finish my work day now (snow days aren't snow days anymore), but I hope you'll hang on as we restructure and bring this sub back to life. 

P.S. Mods should serve at the discretion of the community for benefit of the community. The hardest part of all of this for me was watching as someone who did not have the community's interest at heart acting like a petty tyrant.

Teachers are belittled and taken advantage of to ensure we are kept in our place. We are constantly micromanaged so that we don’t think we are capable of other work or functioning and having success on our own in another workplace. This micromanagement/belittling is done to keep highly qualified teachers in the place where society needs us to be in order to take advantage of us. We are capable and qualified for many other things. Not to mention higher salaries.

Think of how much you had to learn on the job in a short amount of time in your first year of teaching. You are adaptable; sell that in your cover letter. You adapted to the pivot from in-person to online learning and you probably did it overnight; that makes you tech savvy. Be confident in yourself because you are worth more than you realize.

We have some interim admins and a new super. My 3 evals, last year went up consecutively. This year my veal numbers are heading in the wrong direction. I just had my second of the year today and it was bad.

Those who evaluated me last year seemed very caring and like they were genuinely interested in making sure I improved. This year it’s much different, as a non-tenured teacher I feel my job is always at risk. I do not want to feel like this for another two year.

My lesson was not perfect but I felt that it was harsh given the sample size and context of the lesson. I feel that both observations I’ve had this year the take away is, “I would have done this, so that’s what you should have done.” I never want to lose my individuality as a teacher. 

It seems to add what they want in every single one of my lessons getting through the curriculum is out of reach and would take hours more planning. Some nights as is I plan and make materials till 10 or 11 pm. I don’t know how much more I can mentally give. 

I am very passionate and love my students, perhaps it’s an obvious bias, but I feel like I am an effective teacher.  These observations and administrators are making me feel down on myself, worried about job security, and like maybe this isn’t for me.

I don't even know how it began. I was sitting at my desk getting attendance done; the kids were supposed to be writing some answers on a notecard. Then out of nowhere I hear C just blow up. I stand up and I see him sitting there, his face all read as he's telling F that he's tired of his shit.  He keeps repeating, ""I'm tired of your shit!"" He slams his iPad down on the desk and stands up. The whole time I'm trying to get them to stop yelling at each other, but they have no interest in me in the slightest. F stands up as well, posturing to fight. They're at the verbal threats phase when I make it to the phone and dial for assistance. 

I'm still working hard to de-escalate the situation and try to keep these kids from killing each other but they're completely deaf to anything I have to say. Our psychologist (whose room is across from mine) comes over, and so does my neighbor teacher - she left her class because she heard the commotion. Someone flips the lights on, the psychologist calls on her radio for assistance as well. They're trying to help de-escalate. Our campus monitor shows up and grabs F because it was getting close to swinging, and he has to drag the kid out of the room. After he's gone, C focuses on another student and says something to her, about how he's tired of her, as well. She's taken aback, but some of the kids are now laughing. 

They finally escort C out of the room too. The kids can't seem to stop talking about it. They're laughing, it's a huge fucking joke to them. I tell them it's not funny. One girl says, ""It lowkey kinda is."" I said no, it's not. I try to be a chill, calm teacher and I don't like violence, yelling, fighting, and the fact that two kids nearly came to it in my classroom is *not* fucking funny. I apologize on behalf of the other kids, saying that is not the atmosphere I want to promote in my room. Some of them are still laughing. It feels like a punch to the gut - this is the best thing that will happen to most of these kids all day, and I'm fighting back a panic attack. I'm glad for the support from other staff, but where the fuck are the administrators? And what is so wrong with our society these days that two kids on the verge of pummeling each other is hilarious? 

I do manage get them back on task - but what does it matter? There won't be any consequences. They probably will not even remove either kid from my class. This is just the world we apparently live in now.",TeacherReality

The interventionist asked one of my co workers in PLC today where she was at on the unit and my co worker respectfully said she was not following the unit calendar but was still teaching the same material. The gifted teacher began to blow up at her and got angry that my co worker was not using this plan because it ""fit the prociency scale perfectly"". She continued to lay into her for no good reason and then thankfully, the bell rang. 

Fast forward to the afternoon PLC meeting. My other co workers brought up the incident so I said that I think what we were trying to convey this morning is that her and I are trying to meet the students where they are at skills wise. The gifted teacher then proceeded to lay into me and YELLED at me because ""there's no difference between any of the students on other teams"". Except that... I teach the ELL, intervention, and iep kids. She was so rude to me and then the advanced English teacher jumped in and literally said this comment to me ""that's what teaching is, we break things down so that the kids can understand it"". All I was trying to explain to them was that I had started the unit plan last week from day 1 and decided today that I was going to go back and re teach claim, evidence, and reasoning. It really was the most unprofesisonal thing I have experienced.

I found out from my co teacher that one of the 8th grade teachers leaves PLC in tears whenever the gifted teacher attends their meetings. This is not an isolated incident. 

I felt so undermined in that moment as a professional. I was shaking when I went to my meeting with my instructional coach because I was about to cry. I explained to my coach what happened and we sat down to go over the proficiency scale. She told me I was right on target and to focus on students building a strong argumentative paragraph instead of a five paragraph essay.

This was a scary situation and I felt very alone. I would like to give some clarification of this incident as well as an update. Warning, it's still in progress but so far it hasn't been great. For context, I work with high schoolers in a rural town.

The situation was this: I was observing the lunchroom when he made a comment about someone's ass. I turned around and he said ""Why'd you turn around?"" In the moment I was very confused and it seemed like he had been speaking about me. As I stated, I informed my supervisor and principal. The next day the student found me while I was doing bus duty and he started yelling at me. When I informed the Principal, she later asked me if I would be willing to sit down and discuss it with him to ""take my power back"". We just had the meeting today...two weeks later.

The student alleged that they had been ""talking about their friend behind me"", and I just happened to turn around. I told him how bad it looked, and how he had no right talking to *anyone* that way. And that the reason why I had approached the principal about the situation was that if anyone looked at the incident from an outside perspective (adult and minor flirting), I could lose my job. I had to protect myself. I reiterated that his aggressive approach to me after the incident did not help his case either. He apologized for his behavior and for ""any unnecessary trauma he may have caused."" Whether he meant it or not is still up for debate...

I am currently in the process of trying to set up a meeting with HR to discuss how this was handled. How it felt like this was taken lightly, and not as serious as it could be. How I did not feel safe the, again, *two weeks* it took to set this meeting up. I asked for a male coworker to stand with me during bus duty just to feel slightly safer at my own job.

I also have informed my Union Rep, though technically I'm still in the process of having my application accepted. She is on my side and has been supporting me through all of this.

I'm sorry this isn't the big, badass update you all may have been wanting. But I'm still trying to find my footing in this. I promise I won't stop and let this slide.

I was talking to my wife about this exact topic last night and she said that a lot of teachers feel that way and that I wouldn't understand because I never have felt that way about a job and looking at these replies and thinking about it more I think she's right. 


I don't know if there's a way to word this without it coming off as maybe a little offensive but I am curious the thoughts of teachers on it.

I've been following the events of the last several years in regards to education. It seems like half the country just has a pretty anti-education stance at this point. They're banning books, parents are threatening teachers and administrators at board meetings, the kids seem to be out of control and not to give a shit largely... Cities don't properly fund schools so that teachers are expected to teach more and more kids each class to the point where it just seems impossible to do a good job. Schools are putting kids in debt for food... Also if you think of the salary that teachers get as a metric of how valued they are by society it's not good and honestly it's never been good. A huge and disproportionally powerful chunk of society just seems to be making it their personal mission to make the profession shittier.

My question is, why don't you just throw your hands up and go fuck it, fuck these kids and their stupid parents. The parents want to tell me how to teach, you teach your dumb kids then and they're going to grow up to be dumb fucks just like you, not my problem anymore. Do you feel trapped in the profession because it's what you went to school for? You're all smart people wouldn't a company want to hire you for something? Why not just quit and wash your hands of it all and just stop thinking about it. The country doesn't value education anymore and that seems to be getting worse so why not just give up on it?

I'm not a student or a parent and I never will be a parent so maybe that's why I have this attitude? I vote on increasing the budget and funding for schools whenever possible but I feel like people just don't value it, they don't want to pay for it.

1642700113.0,"Teachers punching kids, my controversial (?) take.","If you're not aware of it, there was a video posted a little while ago where a kid is being terrible, the teacher reaches a breaking point, and the teacher swings.

*Tldr at bottom*

Down near the bottom of that thread, you'll find my comments. Which I acknowledge were poorly phrased, and you'll see they got a lot of downvotes. I want to take a second to express myself better, and hopefully have a discussion, if people still disagree with me and want to downvote that's cool I'll eat it.

When we see a teacher taking a swing at a kid, and all we do is condemn the teacher or applaud the teacher, we're missing the chance for a good conversation. It should go without saying that it is almost never appropriate for an adult to hit a kid.

Just in case it's not clear, the teacher should not have hit the kid.

With that said, I don't think we can just condemn the teacher and walk away. We have to condemn the systemic failings that put the teacher in that situation in the first place. Because it's easy to judge from the other side of a keyboard. But every single person has a breaking point.

I am not a teacher right now, specifically because I knew it was not good for me to be somewhere where I was going to have to dance on that line.


**Back to the controversial thought.**

In America we have primary positions where we expect people to deal with the public as an authority. Teachers, and cops. I'm going to leave out my political opinions on cops, because I don't think it's worthwhile in this discussion, but I will simply say that de-escalation should play a much higher role, and violence a much smaller role, in policing.

Regardless, cops have a pretty big tool belt when it comes to carrying out their objectives, maintaining their authority, and trying to feel safe. Regardless of abuse, that's not the topic, there are a lot of tools.

What tools do teachers get? Ask nicely? Call the office and hope they come down?

And as a cop, you're not in a high stress situation from the moment you clock into the moment you clock out. Even on the worst beat, you've got a partner, you can go back and hang out in your car for a little bit, back up is always waiting to come. It's not you on the streets by yourself for 8 hours straight with pretty much no help.

Not even mentioning the boomers who think school is bad now because physical punishment is a thing of the past. Guess what? You could have googled 2 seconds to find [meta-studies](https://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/journals-and-magazines/social-policy-journal/spj27/27-pages114-127.pdf) showing that physical punishment doesn't work.

You remind me of the horrors I used to hear in the teacher's lounge. Teachers saying horrible things about their students in their back. What the fuck was wrong with them? And with some of you?

Now I understand it probably was not a coincidence that I was the **only** teacher in the whole school that had a great relationship with the students, with my classes always being kind-of-quiet, never losing my composure... and that I was the only one who seemed to respect the students as actual people.

Being a teacher suck, I get it. That's why I left, I don´t want to babysit 30+ teens at once on minimum wage. But what happened to you all that you think it's okay to **sucker-punch a kid in the face** ? What's the fucking excuse? Because a literal KID was MEAN to you? Go to fucking therapy instead! That's what grown-ups do.

Jesus, guys. Get a grip. Those kids are not your enemies. Yes, even the ones that try to abuse you verbally. They're fucking troubled kids, and yes they can be hard as fuck to manage, and they REALLY shouldn't be there, and yes everyone is being an ungrateful bitch to you. I know how much teaching sucks, that's why I left. Please leave too before you start thinking it's okay to fucking punch kids in the face.

I was on this sub to try and help people to get out, sharing my experience in Big Tech where I make much more money and don't have to deal with school shit. But if you're all damaged to the point where physical assault seems justified, I'll gladly accept my ban.

Edit: Jesus fucking christ some of you really should be ashamed to call yourself ""teachers"" or even just ""adults"".",TeacherReality

1642655762.0,First Year Teacher and I Already Believe I'm a Terrible Instructor and Ready to Leave,"Hey everyone,

I apologize for the long rant I am about to make. I just feel so lost and need some advice on job opportunities. Please skip to the end if need be. I just need to get my thoughts out somewhere.

As the title states, I am a new teacher who is teaching English, and I never had the opportunity to student teach before the pandemic hit. Got a job across the state after finishing my master's in theater (English BA), and I was so excited to be pursuing my desired career and not living off unemployment looking for anything to survive. The salary is the best I have made in my life so far (late 20s for reference), which is sad, yet I thought it was the start to a wonderful stage in my life to begin helping out kids and doing my best to be an effective instructor...that is up until now. 

I.feel.awful. I am a terrible teacher. No one prepared me for what things would be like. I had an understanding that the first year or two may be rough, yet not like this. I know I am going to make many mistakes, yet didn't expect to receive such backlash from students and parents, and I feel so worthless. While my admin and fellow teachers are supportive and say this will pass and to just survive, I feel like I have been thrown to the wolves. No resources or guidance given to me on what to teach, and every unit and lesson plan I make is on the fly. Every day I am just wondering how a lesson or unit will go that I can create on my off time, since my planning periods are busy covering for teachers out from covid. Some days are great, and many other days the lessons don't work. That's fine, it's part of the growing pains right? That's what I want to believe...I want to believe I am doing the best I can with the hand I have been dealt, yet still feel like a joke of a teacher.

The kids overall are just disrespectful and nasty to me. I feel like I am failing them, yet I am trying so hard and learning as well. Even with how they treat me, I care about their education and want them all to be successful. Some are wonderful and enjoy the theatrical display I put on as I pretend I am not screaming internally and teach them what I can, yet it is exhausting. My mental health has plummeted. I dread going to work or having to talk with my students.

 I let teenagers get to me as they give me lip and don't pay attention or refuse to do work...and these are honors students. They view any new teacher as inferior and not worth their time. Even when they haven't been taught a good amount over the last few years, like writing a properly formatted essay...they just don't follow and refuse to believe I know what I am talking about...and when I don't give them As because they did it wrong or was written poorly? Parents come lashing out because I am a problem teacher. Their child never fails, so it's my fault they are. How dare I not give them an A like others do. The ones who don't even turn it in? Admin says give them a 50 at best. Don't give Fs otherwise. Never a 0.

I try my best to be patient with them and not lose my cool, because it's not professional or right to raise my voice in a mean way or return the nasty behavior. On the days where I can get students to follow along and learn, I feel a little better about myself...until the moment I make one tiny mistake, and I am jumped on. As for admin helping me with behavior? A slap on the wrist for that kid being rude and they are fine as they don't want to ""upset the parents"". 

I feel helpless. Does it get better? Did I pick the worst time to jump in as a new teacher during a pandemic? Or is this the reality and future of education in the US? Am I just bad at this job? I am just so unhappy and tearing myself apart mentally and it's affecting my life outside and my personal relationships. 

To all of the teachers who have had more years of experience and go through this; I absolutely respect you. I feel weak and mentally soft for feeling this way after only five months. I don't know how many of you are still doing this. The only reason why I feel motivated to even go to work is because I feel like I have no other way to get a job with a reasonable income. 

Should I just quit? I don't even know what jobs a new English teacher with minimal experience in education could do. I have mostly been a student before this. I just feel so lost and defeated and I feel terrible writing this. For those who have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my rant. I am already considering finding a therapist to help me out with my depressed state. I just need to know what routes to even consider. 



TL;DR: New English teacher with no prior experience, not even student teaching. I feel like a terrible teacher and the job and treatment from students and parents has left me in a dangerously depressive state. Looking for a way out to save my well being, or the advice to tough it out.",TeacherReality

1642610078.0,Has teaching negatively affected your memory?,"I'm generally curious about this. I have been teaching for 4 years and over these years i feel my ability to remember even the simplest of things has severely deteriorated. I forget things that happened just a few hours ago, maybe my brain is just on auto pilot and everything is a blur? Though over the school breaks my memory recovers and everything gets back to normal.

Does anybody else have this issue or is it just me?",TeacherReality

1642642837.0,I think (hope) I’m on my way out,"I’ve been teaching for several years on an emergency teaching license- I’ve taught a different subject each year so I’ve changed the emergency license each time. Well, I got word that tomorrow I’m going to be informed that I will be formally written up for breaking up a would be fight- I didn’t touch any student, I did use an object to move one  student away, but no one was even the slightest bit hurt. The parent of the aggressor is apparently pushing this because their child said I threw something at him, which definitely did not happen. There were no security cameras in place to record anything and no other adults around, just a class full of kids, so it’s my word against the (one) kid’s. These were younger students but old enough to seriously hurt one another, something which I have seen happen and have prevented on many occasions. So anyway, apparently I’m going to be written up. I’m also not a part of the teachers union (I guess if you’re planning on staying I would recommend joining yours if you have one). I’ve been passively looking to get out of teaching for over a year, but the pay is decent here and you can’t beat the time off. Anyway, I’m actively looking now, wish me luck.",TeacherReality
