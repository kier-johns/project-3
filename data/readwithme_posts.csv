1697065041.0,Press Release,"Dive into a Turbulent Tale of Survival with Denise Ann Stock’s Latest Novel: ""Summer (With Collateral Damage)""
Navigate the eye of the storm and face unforeseen dangers with Denise Ann Stock’s latest pulse-pounding thriller novel, “Summer (With Collateral Damage).” Lauded for inducing heart-pounding terror in its readers, this book is your ticket to an enthralling escape, where the thrill of adventure collides with the raw terror of reality.
Strategic Book Publishing is thrilled to announce the launch of Denise Ann Stock's captivating fourth novel in her acclaimed series, ""Summer (With Collateral Damage),"" where two harrowing threats - one from nature and one man-made - conjoin to forge a heart-stopping narrative.
In this thrilling new release, we journey back with the
Connor Family, this time meeting Alyse Johnson, an
attorney with a quiet beachfront life that is about to be
shaken to its core. Alyse, alongside her friends in the
Connor family, resolves to endure a daunting Category 4
hurricane by barricading themselves in their upscale beach properties. Little do they know, a tempest of another kind—in the form of relentless burglars—sweeps through their abandoned neighborhood, revealing that their greatest test may not be the storm outside but the emerging threat from within. The stormy darkness, while obscuring, lays bare the most vivid of human strengths and frailties.
Lynn Eddy, VP of Acquisitions at Strategic Book Publishing, warns future readers: ""Heart- pounding terror is in store not only for the characters in the book, but for readers as well. Be ready to get scared.""
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" has been distinguished with the prestigious Literary Titan Gold Book Award, an accolade that underscores its rich narrative. Literary Titan praised the novel, expressing that ""Stock does a beautiful job of building an air of mystery,"" lauding the way it engrosses readers by letting their ""imaginations run wild as they wait for the subsequent development.” Alyse Johnson's journey offers a tale where “Romance fans will appreciate the internal struggle"" and ""mystery fans [will find] the thrill they seek.” In bestowing the award, Literary Titan recognizes the intricate plot that holds readers captive but also the emotional depth and thrilling suspense that echo through every chapter.
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" is available now on Kindle and in paperback on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Immerse yourself in a gripping tale that promises to whisk readers into a maelstrom of fear, bravery, and survival.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
    
About the Book
In the luminous world of Alyse Johnson, the tranquility of a privileged beachside existence is mercilessly shattered. This summer, the calm of the Jacksonville Beach is obliterated not just by the cataclysmic fury of a Category 4 hurricane but also by intruders who ruthlessly exploit the chaos, invading the once-peaceful community Alyse calls home.
Locked within the sturdy walls alongside the steadfast Connor family, Alyse isn’t just fighting against the brutal elements outside. As the storm ravages her surroundings, an internal storm of emotions also unfurls as she grapples with turbulent feelings towards Christian, her best friend’s brother and the one person she should stay away from.
Two tempests, external and internal, intertwine to forge a tale where the palpitations of the heart echo the howling of the wind and where every creak and whisper may signify either a clandestine romance or lurking danger.
Will Alyse navigate through these intertwining storms to find peace amidst chaos and love amidst fear?

If Kemmerich had had any use for these boots, Muller would have run barefoot over the barbed wire rather than racking his brain how to get hold of them.""

there have been no real losses in my life yet, it's hard for me to understand whether a person losing someone close can think about ""boots"". maybe Muller's soul was coarsened in the war? fear for his own life, living through grief more often than a person should experience, have taught him to step over, giving place to thoughts about how he will have to live on his own?

[**Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-5020a2d6a968) is one of the past half-century’s most influential philosophical books. This novel was published in the 1960s, and was written by Robert Pirsig (1928–2017 Robert M. Pirsig), who enrolled at the University of Minnesota at 15, majored in chemistry and became interested in philosophy before traveling to India to study Eastern philosophy. In 1961, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression and was admitted to a mental hospital several times. After his release in 1968, he took his son Chris on a long motorcycle trip. He took his reflections from the trip and wrote this book.  The book’s central theme is to ask what is good, valuable, and quality in the journey. By thinking about the metaphysics of quality and value, it also reflects on how we live today and how to work and live better.

I have a modest shelf of books that were mostly given to me by others, the majority of them sporting bookmarks abandoned about 50 pages in before I lost interest. Most of my books are self-help/psychology books my avid-reader mother has given me (trying to tell me something mom??) or religious books that have been gifted to me. These can be intriguing for a bit, but I don’t believe I have ever finished one. Back in high school my friends used to convince me to read romance novels with them, and I just could never help but roll my eyes over the predictability and cliche of teen romance, or ANOTHER Nicholas Sparks novel set in the Carolina’s.

Have I just not found my genre? It kind of annoyed me when I looked at my bookshelf the other day and realized how few of the books I actually picked out myself. Any recommendations for how to figure out what kind of books I might like? I just did a quick quiz online and it recommended “the city we became” and I am quite intrigued by the description although it looks a bit long for me at 480 pages given my track record.

In 2012, a powerful solar storm struck the planet, burning out power grids, causing batteries to surge and bringing civilization to an abrupt end. Amid the chaos, Ryan meets Abigail at the back of an alley. Trust is established quickly and together, they begin their journey to safety, sharing the bond of lovers.

They walked into the school it looked like there normally school but in fact it wasn’t, they walked down the halls and saw  Mary chain to the chair in the lunchroom they walked up to her and tired to unchain her. They look everywhere to find a A way to free her finally they found the key under a bowl on the kitchen counter of the lunch room, and freed form the chair. “Mary why where you chained up?” They asked Mary replied “I don’t know how you guys manage to escape, but after you all left what ever kids where left her got chained up as prisoners. They died form starvation, beaten to death, or left alone for isolation only to be feed once a day to Servaes like I have. I can tell you didn’t figure out a way of escaping because you look 100% healthy and I also remember not everyone being here when it happened that’s why I say I don’t know how you escaped but who ever wasn’t as fortunate to escape was left here to suffer.” Merlin asked “what do you mean we never left the school, we do know though one day we went to school and you where not there and we all asked where is Mary but no one new. So now that we are older we decided to find out what happened to you and we went back to school to find out if they was any clues on why you disappeared.” Mary replied “I’m not sure why you, remember staying in school but this was not a school anymore after that day that lady came in and captured the school.” Marlin and Maya looked shocked and confused because that never happened what is she taking about.

They put their hands on her chest, and listen to her heart and her breath “she’s not breathing.” The lady started coming towards them. Maya tried grabbing the book from her. She started to bit and pinch Maya, Maya tried pinching her back but she couldn’t for what ever reason she then decided to say while t holding the dragon book “once I was 7 now make me 7 again” she figured she’d say this because she wasn’t as strong as the lady and she Felt like she had more energy at seven years old, to her surprise she went back into time. She had to find out what had happened and fix it. She ran  A-crossed her passed self and asked her “can you help me out. Your family Mary and most the school is in trouble, And if I can’t get the dragon book in your classroom I might not be able to help.” So little Maya got the book off the shelf hiding it form the teacher and gave it to bigger Maya “here you go, now you can save us. I gotta go back to school bye.” So bigger Maya then took a lighter to the book saying “if this brought me back here, this has to be the reason we had are disaster losing half of our students in this school to a which.

There are many subgenres for memoir, but so far, I haven't heard of subgenres like thriller or mystery memoir. I find this amazing. Someone, somewhere, must have had (and wrote about) a thrilling or mysterious period in their life, right?

**Ram woke up in a new world as a ghost, with a lifespan of two hours.**

However, he had a system that allowed him to increase his lifespan and also gave him formidable abilities.

The catch? Well, it's nothing sinister -- Just a small requirement to feast on the fear of unsuspecting souls, or eat them outright.

Link : [Devil In Making](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68311/devil-in-making-a-xianxia-litrpg)

Currently has more than 50k words.

**1 chapter per day (1.5k+ words)**

What to expect:

\- While the story primarily focuses on Xianxia elements, it also incorporates elements of Progression Fantasy, Horror, and a System.

\- The protagonist slowly transforms into a villainous (or anti-hero)  character as he adapts to the world around him in order to survive. He is not evil from the start.

\- The plot maintains an equal emphasis on both intricate scheming and intense fight scenes.

\- Expect well-developed side characters with their own individual character arcs.

\- Initially, the story features multiple points of view (POVs), but as the narrative progresses, the number of POVs decreases to maintain a smoother and more focused storytelling experience.",readwithme

1682829587.0,The Unbinding,"Hello! I’m a new writer and just posted the first seven chapter of my book The Unbinding: Rotten to the Roots. The synopsis is as follows: 

Inspector Kint is a simple man. He lives in District 13, a simple district. There is no crime in District 13, which makes his Job a simple Job. Kint likes it when things are simple. They’ve been that way for quite a few years now. When things are simple, Inspector Kint can get along by playing the Curmudgeonly old fool and no one bats an eye.

But in Kaden City, the capital of an empire that spans half the globe, things can become complicated very quickly. Especially when the ambitious Lord Crecius of the Apostle families reaches down from his home in the silver spires of the Ignatium and chooses Kint to be the one to cover up his wretched secrets.

With violence rising for the first time in his tenure, the Church of the Prophet escalating their rhetoric, and an epidemic of sleepless nights pushing the district to its limits, the dangerous game of politics could be the least of Kint’s problems. His days of playing fool may be over. For as Inspector Kint delves into the rotten underbelly of Kaden City, with malicious eyes watching his every move, he’ll have to protect his own secrets as well, and they might be far worse than any Lords…

1681169348.0,Read Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture," The book written by architectural theorist C. Norberg-Schulz reveals that the [relationship between us and the environment is inherently meaningful](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/return-to-the-origin-of-creation-70b3c5b43eaf). When the living place has meaning, people feel “at home.”  The genius loci, an ancient Roman concept, believed that each entity had its soul.  The authenticity of life is an integral part of the genius loci. Lawrence Durrell wrote in 1960.

*“If you want to get to know Europe slowly, taste the wine, cheese, and the characteristics of various rural areas, and you will begin to appreciate that the most important determining factor of any culture is ultimately the spirit of place.”*

 The emergence of alienation in modern society is mainly because modern places provide too few possibilities for direction and identification. The changes in some cities are too drastic, resulting in a complete loss of continuity with the stable essence of the previous place, which leads to a strong sense of alienation in people. However, some historically significant cities such as Prague and Rome have maintained the continuity of the essence of the place in a changing world, thereby providing a better solution to human psychological issues.

As a young entrepreneur, I am always looking for ways to improve people's lives. For a while now, I had an idea I wanted to run by the community. 

Would you be interested in a book journal that can capture what you learned from the book? With categories such as:

\- People, Leadership, Relationships, Goals, life as well as a place to summarize the book and write down quotes?

Backstory:

I, for instance, create a book journal every year for myself (that gets filled pretty fast), which is a lot of work but has helped me so so much in my personal as well as professional life. I only wish there was a book journal I could buy with similar features to the ones mentioned. However, that is not the case which is why I am thinking of producing some myself and selling them.

Is that something you folks would be interested in, or is it a bad idea? 

I would love to hear what you have to say!!

Thank you for your time

I just discovered an amazing new lofi video on YouTube that I just have to share with you all! This track is inspired by the lofi girl channel and it's the perfect addition to anyone's lofi playlist.

The track has a laid-back and calming vibe that makes it perfect for studying, reading, or just relaxing. The jazzy chords and smooth beats are incredibly soothing, and the atmospheric textures add a lovely depth to the overall sound.

I know that there are a ton of lofi videos out there, but this one really stands out to me. The production quality is top-notch, and it's clear that the creator poured a lot of love and care into making this track.

So if you're looking for a new lofi video to add to your playlist, or if you're just in the mood for some chill vibes, then I highly recommend checking out this track. Trust me, it's worth it!

Here's the link: [**https://youtu.be/pnTlT3PDQhQ**](https://youtu.be/pnTlT3PDQhQ)

1675310011.0,Trying to spark my reading passion again,"I used to be the most avid reader I knew. I would consume 5-6 books in a week. When it came to graphic novels/comics, I was devouring them 3-5 in a day. I had a hunger I was happy to feed and support.

I used to write every day and was inspired by the things I read. I finished my first 500-page novel in fall 2013. I did NaNoWriMo in 2014 for my second novel. If I wasn't working on my main passions/novel I was creating backstories for created characters in video games. Every one of my RPG characters had huge backstories and I sculpted them to hone my skills. I had another side project for writing that was mostly fanfic of my life where I let off steam.

I used to be a lot of things.

The last books I read were in June, a couple of Mira Grant's works. I also enjoyed an audiobook in August.

I'm currently unemployed due to health reasons. Since I'm home all the time I bought some books I've been looking at for years. I wanted to push myself for the 52 book challenge this year. It's not going well.

The book I'm reading is one I should've picked up ten years ago. It's good. Interesting. I want to read more. I want to feel normal again and *read*. It doesn't have to be in crazy volumes. A book a week. Even a book every two weeks.

So I found the perfect time to get some reading time in: physical therapy. A portion of my therapy is sitting in a chair connected to a machine. My first time reading during therapy felt amazing. I was *enjoying* the story. But my second, most recent, time scared me.

I'm in the chair reading, people and patients are around me, and I'm sucked into the story. I felt like I was *in* the book, experiencing what the MC experienced. It was breathtaking. My eyes danced through the lines, absorbing the words and *seeing* the scene. I was so into my book that when my timer went off and I pulled my eyes away, I felt groggy.

I was disoriented and my mind felt fuzzy. One of the therapists that works with me came over, we went over a few things, and I was finished for the day. But as I closed the book and retrieved my things I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. I had been so distracted! What if someone had said my name? Or needed something? I wasn't aware of my surroundings and it freaked me out.

Part of me loved that sensation of becoming a part of what I read. The other was scared of being taken out of reality. I walked out of the building feeling as if on air, wobbly but on a high, I guess?

I want to read this book, finish it, read more books, and have reading closer to my heart like it used to be. I'm wanting my passion back but I feel like I'm holding myself back.

Does anybody else experience anything similar?  How can I ""get back on the horse"" without freaking myself out?",readwithme

Unlike the conventional rhetoric on success: a result of hard work, talent, environment, and luck, *How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big* by **Scott Adams** provides a fresh perspective and practical strategies, revealing that success isn’t magic and has its subtle pattern.

One of the key [insights](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big-a3380a72dd47) is impressive: to see success as math. Your perception of success matters. You’ve put yourself in a passive position when you view it as magic. Yes, we can't control the luck directly, but we can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with better odds. So you should be proactive and adopt some efficient strategy to put you in the right position, allowing luck to find u easily. It's a great point!!",readwithme

1674679145.0,Bravery of Indian Soldiers,"One such story is that of Lance Naik Hanumanthappa Koppad, a soldier in the Indian Army who served in the Siachen Glacier region. In February 2016, an avalanche buried an army post where Lance Naik Koppad was stationed, burying him and nine other soldiers under 25 feet of snow.

Despite being buried for six days, Lance Naik Koppad was miraculously found alive by rescue teams, but he was in critical condition with severe hypothermia and multiple organ failure. He was airlifted to a military hospital in Delhi, where he received extensive medical treatment, but unfortunately, he passed away a few days later.

Lance Naik Koppad's story is a reminder of the sacrifice and bravery of Indian soldiers who serve in some of the most inhospitable and dangerous regions of the world. His story touched the hearts of people across India, and he was hailed as a national hero for his service and sacrifice.

Another story is of Captain Vikram Batra, an officer in the Indian Army who served in the Kargil War in 1999. Captain Batra was known for his bravery and leadership on the battlefield, and he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration for valor, for his actions during the war.

On July 7, 1999, while leading his men in an attack on a heavily fortified enemy position, Captain Batra was critically injured by a grenade. Despite his injuries, he continued to lead his men and was able to capture the enemy position before succumbing to his wounds.

Captain Batra's story is a testament to the selfless bravery and sacrifice of Indian soldiers who defend our country and its people. He and many other brave soldiers like him will always be remembered for their service and sacrifice in the line of duty.",readwithme
1674678959.0,Story From Pakistan,"Once upon a time, there was a man named Malala Yousafzai. She was born in Pakistan in 1997, and from a young age, she was passionate about education and women's rights.

Growing up, Malala attended a school run by her father, where she was one of only a few girls to receive an education. As she grew older, she became increasingly aware of the discrimination and lack of educational opportunities faced by girls in her community, and she began to speak out against it.

In 2008, at the age of 11, Malala wrote a blog for the BBC about her life under the Taliban's rule and their efforts to prevent girls from going to school. Her blog was anonymous, but her identity was later revealed, and it made her a target for the Taliban.

In 2012, Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while she was on her way home from school. She was rushed to a hospital and was in critical condition for a time, but she miraculously survived the attack.

Despite the danger, Malala continued to speak out for education and women's rights. She became an advocate for girls' education and founded the Malala Fund, an organization that works to empower girls through access to education.

In 2014, at the age of 17, Malala became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in promoting education and women's rights. Today she continues to speak out on issues of education and women's rights, and she continues to inspire people around the world to fight for a just and equal society.

Malala's story is a testament to the power of one person's voice and determination to make a difference in the world, and how even in the face of adversity and violence, one can still rise above and make a positive impact.",readwithme

1674486823.0,Motivational story of Sarah," 

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah. Sarah was a very determined and ambitious person, but she had always struggled with self-doubt and insecurity. Despite her talents and hard work, she often felt like she wasn't good enough and that she would never be able to achieve her dreams.

One day, Sarah decided that she wanted to become a professional dancer. She worked hard to improve her skills and began to take dance classes every day. But even as she improved, her self-doubt held her back. She was too scared to audition for any dance companies or competitions.

Sarah's dance teacher noticed her struggles and told her about a famous dancer named Misty Copeland. Misty had also faced many obstacles in her career, including being told that she was too old and not the right body type to be a professional ballet dancer. But she didn't let those setbacks hold her back, and she eventually became the first African-American principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre.

Sarah was inspired by Misty's story and realized that she could overcome her own self-doubt. She decided to audition for a local dance company and was thrilled when she got the part. From that moment on, she began to believe in herself and her abilities.

Sarah continued to push herself and eventually landed a spot in a prestigious dance school. She worked hard, and her dedication and hard work paid off when she got a job as a professional dancer.

Years passed and Sarah became a famous dancer, traveling the world and performing in front of thousands of people. She was proud of herself and happy to have overcome her self-doubt and achieved her dream.

Sarah's story shows that with hard work, determination and not giving up on yourself, anyone can achieve their dreams regardless of the setbacks they face. This story is meant to inspire and motivate, that no matter how hard the path may be, with hard work and perseverance, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your dreams.",readwithme

1674388944.0,Overcoming My Fear of Public Speaking,"I remember the first time I had to give a presentation in front of a large group of people. I was in college and had been assigned to give a speech on a topic of my choosing. As soon as I got up to the podium, my heart started racing, my palms were sweating, and my mind went blank. I stumbled through the presentation, my voice shaking and my hands trembling. I was humiliated and couldn't wait for it to be over.

From that day on, I avoided any situation that required public speaking. I would make excuses not to attend meetings or events where I knew I would have to speak in front of others. I even turned down job opportunities because they required me to give presentations.

But as I entered the workforce, I realized that public speaking is an important skill to have in many careers, including mine. I knew that if I wanted to advance in my career, I would have to overcome my fear of public speaking.

So, I decided to take action. I started small, by giving speeches to small groups of friends and family. As I became more comfortable, I gradually increased the size of the audience. I also read books and articles on public speaking, and found a local Toastmasters group where I could practice my skills in a supportive environment.

But the most important thing I did was to face my fear head-on. I signed up to give a presentation at a local conference. I was petrified, but I knew that this was my chance to prove to myself that I could do it. I prepared for weeks, rehearsing my speech and visualizing myself giving it.

On the day of the conference, I was still nervous, but I felt more prepared than ever before. As I walked up to the podium, I felt my nerves dissipate, and I was able to deliver my speech with confidence. I received positive feedback from the audience, and it was one of the most empowering moments of my life.

Now, I am not saying that I never get nervous when I have to speak in public, but I have learned how to manage my nerves and it has become much easier for me. Public speaking is still not my favorite thing to do, but it is no longer something that I fear. I have realized that facing my fears head-on has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. And I would encourage anyone who is struggling with the same fear to do the same.",readwithme
1674388682.0,My Journey to Becoming a Professional Gamer,"When I was a kid, I never could have imagined that playing video games would one day become my career. But that's exactly what happened. My name is Jack and I'm a professional gamer.

It all started when I was in high school. I had always been a big fan of video games, but I never thought of them as more than just a hobby. But one day, a friend introduced me to the world of esports - competitive gaming. I was immediately hooked. I started playing in local tournaments and quickly realized that I had a real talent for the game.

After graduating high school, I decided to take my passion for gaming to the next level. I enrolled in a college with a strong esports program and started to focus on becoming a professional gamer. I spent countless hours practicing, studying strategies, and honing my skills.

It wasn't easy - balancing college coursework with my gaming commitments was a constant struggle. But I knew that if I wanted to succeed in the competitive world of esports, I had to put in the work.

Eventually, all my hard work paid off. I started getting noticed by professional teams and was eventually signed to one of the top teams in the world. I couldn't believe it - I was living my dream of becoming a professional gamer.

But being a professional gamer is not just about playing the game - it's also about being a role model and representative of the team. I have to maintain a good image and conduct myself professionally, as well as to keep my physical and mental health in check.

Since then, I've competed in major tournaments all over the world, and I've even won a few championships. But what I'm most proud of is the impact I've been able to make on the esports community. I've inspired countless young people to pursue their own dreams of becoming professional gamers, and I'm honored to be a part of something that is changing the way the world sees video games.

I know that my journey as a professional gamer is far from over. There will be challenges and setbacks along the way, but I'm excited for what's to come. I'm grateful for the opportunity to do something I love every day and to be able to make a living doing it.

So if you're reading this and you're thinking about pursuing your own dream of becoming a professional gamer, my advice to you is to never give up. Believe in yourself and put in the work, and you'll be surprised at what you can accomplish.",readwithme
1674334570.0,Book ideas to read together with a partner,"Hi! My (28f) partner (30m) gave me a gift for Christmas, a voucher as such, to redeem, and that is he has offered to basically have a little mini book club with me. 

My partner doesn't read, it's not his hobby, but it's definitely one of mine, something I haven't had much time for since having my son, and I'm eager to take this as an opportunity to get back into it.

I'm really looking for ideas of what we could read together, I don't want to pick something as long as The Stand, but I don't want it to be super short either. But also I just don't want him to get bored half way through and give up, because reading isn't his thing. 

Do you think it would be better to read something new to both of us? Or one of my old favourites? And if something new, maybe you could give me some ideas? 

My favourite genres are horror, fantasy and romance, preferably something with all three if I'm honest. My partner strikes me more as a crime thriller vibe, judging by his movie choices over the last few years! I do also really love apocalypse or pandemic stories, The stand is the book I've read most recently that has just really stuck with me, I loved it!

1674235996.0,The Fisherman's luck - An inspirational thought,"**The Fisherman’s luck.**

I genuinely don't know what I'm going to tell you today.

I've tried so many times to think of a great and glamorous incipit, but I still can't think of how to get started. I've been writing it over and over again.

It is known as ""writer's block."" I refer to it as ""fisherman's luck.""

Yes, fisherman’s luck, because ideas are not made, they are found. All you can do is wait like a fisherman patiently waits for a fish to take the bait. Same thing. You sit. You wait. You move around. You wait. You lose your patience. You wait. You lose your hope. You wait. You are just about to give up and then “baam” an idea comes knocking on your door. You smile, you get excited.

But that’s not my story unfortunately.

I know. It sucks; and I promise, I have followed all the guidance, step by step to help an idea come my way. I have waited, my friends… Believe me. I have waited in my room, in the kitchen, by the stairs, on the table, under the table and still… nothing! Not even the most fucking stupid idea has come to me. Nothing!

I feel like I have been left out. I feel like I am the only person in the fucking world who is not capable of coming up with an idea and then doing something good with it. And I hate that feeling! I hate the feeling of not being able to accomplish something while seeing other people succeed. And this is not the first time. 

I hate the feeling of missing out. This is a problem I have been fighting against  since I was a kid. It doesn’t matter what the task is or how many I need to carry out, I still want to make sure that I succeed in all of them, at the same time and with the best outcomes.

I know, you’re going to call me crazy, but this is the devil I have been fighting ever since I can remember: Be the top, be the best, be the bravest, be the number one, be the second to none, be the kindest, be the hero, be the one who saves the world, be yourself, don’t be yourself, be the one in the spotlight, be the one in the corner, be the best friend, be the one who makes more money, be the one that has something to say, be the one that knows when to shut up. Be cool… Be honest. Be arrogant with those who deserve it. Be everywhere. Be nowhere. Just be everything that you can…

BE…

I feel like I have been wearing rugs all my life. I still haven’t found the suit that fits my soul.

 I have no idea who I am, where I am going and what I am looking for.

And with a look on my face like the guy who’s just caught the biggest fish of the day, I stopped and noticed this page is no longer empty. Words have flown in whether I like them or not. 

And such is Life: it goes on regardless of what we think should happen to us.

I salute you my fellow fishermen.",readwithme

1674152176.0,I am able to read books now.,"Ever since young I always hated books, they were boring and picture-less.

I had made an effort to read some but I simply didnt have the attention span and endurance nescessary.

10 years later seems like my problem has been finally fixed in an unexpected way.

For a few years I have been addicted to watching anime, after I ran out of dubbed anime I had to resort to subtitled animes to feed my addiction.

Watching subtitled stuff did hurt my brain at the beggining because I kept having to dart my eyes up and down. but after I got used to it I learned to read using my peripheral vision when the captions were big enough.

Then I decided to watch Saiki Kuso and damn they speak fast, it nearly forced me to double my reading speed to keep up, but its worth it, its the funniest comedy anime ever, go watch it.

The other thing that helped me was getting glasses that actually work, it was hard because no optometrist was able to balance the power of the lenses to reduce strain, but I bought cheap reading glasses from a street vendor and they work much better. 

Now it seems reading is second nature to me and I can do it without paying attention on the text, seems like it frees my mind's eye and now I can simultaneously have a somewhat blurry daydream and read which mean I can daydream what I'm reading as if I was watching it.

Now I finally understand why people read picture-less books, they dont need pictures.",readwithme

I'm a very slow reader, reading these books make me happy and they're helping me read a bit better every day, I can now read 1-2 chapters a day (I used to only be able to read 10-15 pages at a time)

Should I really start reading more complex books? (I'm 19yo)

1. Throughout my entire life, reading has been one of my least favorite things to do in my free time. Usually, the only time I read books and stuff like that is when its for a project or an essay for school. Basically what I'm saying is that I usually only read when its a school thing. Recently, I bought a book titled ""Alexander Hamilton"" by Ron Chernow. The one thing different about this book is that its one of the few times I voluntarily bought a book on my own, without it being for school. As mentioned in the title of this post, I don't like reading, but this book really interested me for some reason. I really want to like reading, but I guess an 800 page nonfiction book that uses words way out of my vocab probably wasn't the best choice. I got to page 4/818 and was already wanting to put the book down and never open it again. It was a good book, even though I only got through 4 pages, but that didn't mean I wanted to keep reading. Its just so hard to sit down and read something like that without me wanting to get up and do something more enjoyable. I just really want to like reading, but for someone like me, its just so difficult. I've already thought of things like ""Well maybe I just don't like these types of books"" or ""Maybe I need to try something more interesting like Harry potter."" but even then, I still found that reading was a struggle for me. How do I enjoy reading?!",readwithme

1697065041.0,Press Release,"Dive into a Turbulent Tale of Survival with Denise Ann Stock’s Latest Novel: ""Summer (With Collateral Damage)""
Navigate the eye of the storm and face unforeseen dangers with Denise Ann Stock’s latest pulse-pounding thriller novel, “Summer (With Collateral Damage).” Lauded for inducing heart-pounding terror in its readers, this book is your ticket to an enthralling escape, where the thrill of adventure collides with the raw terror of reality.
Strategic Book Publishing is thrilled to announce the launch of Denise Ann Stock's captivating fourth novel in her acclaimed series, ""Summer (With Collateral Damage),"" where two harrowing threats - one from nature and one man-made - conjoin to forge a heart-stopping narrative.
In this thrilling new release, we journey back with the
Connor Family, this time meeting Alyse Johnson, an
attorney with a quiet beachfront life that is about to be
shaken to its core. Alyse, alongside her friends in the
Connor family, resolves to endure a daunting Category 4
hurricane by barricading themselves in their upscale beach properties. Little do they know, a tempest of another kind—in the form of relentless burglars—sweeps through their abandoned neighborhood, revealing that their greatest test may not be the storm outside but the emerging threat from within. The stormy darkness, while obscuring, lays bare the most vivid of human strengths and frailties.
Lynn Eddy, VP of Acquisitions at Strategic Book Publishing, warns future readers: ""Heart- pounding terror is in store not only for the characters in the book, but for readers as well. Be ready to get scared.""
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" has been distinguished with the prestigious Literary Titan Gold Book Award, an accolade that underscores its rich narrative. Literary Titan praised the novel, expressing that ""Stock does a beautiful job of building an air of mystery,"" lauding the way it engrosses readers by letting their ""imaginations run wild as they wait for the subsequent development.” Alyse Johnson's journey offers a tale where “Romance fans will appreciate the internal struggle"" and ""mystery fans [will find] the thrill they seek.” In bestowing the award, Literary Titan recognizes the intricate plot that holds readers captive but also the emotional depth and thrilling suspense that echo through every chapter.
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" is available now on Kindle and in paperback on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Immerse yourself in a gripping tale that promises to whisk readers into a maelstrom of fear, bravery, and survival.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
    
About the Book
In the luminous world of Alyse Johnson, the tranquility of a privileged beachside existence is mercilessly shattered. This summer, the calm of the Jacksonville Beach is obliterated not just by the cataclysmic fury of a Category 4 hurricane but also by intruders who ruthlessly exploit the chaos, invading the once-peaceful community Alyse calls home.
Locked within the sturdy walls alongside the steadfast Connor family, Alyse isn’t just fighting against the brutal elements outside. As the storm ravages her surroundings, an internal storm of emotions also unfurls as she grapples with turbulent feelings towards Christian, her best friend’s brother and the one person she should stay away from.
Two tempests, external and internal, intertwine to forge a tale where the palpitations of the heart echo the howling of the wind and where every creak and whisper may signify either a clandestine romance or lurking danger.
Will Alyse navigate through these intertwining storms to find peace amidst chaos and love amidst fear?
About the Author
Denise Ann Stock seamlessly meshes her own coastal upbringing with the stormy suspense of her narratives. A native of Huntington Beach, California - the surfing capital of the world - and now nestling in the sandy retreats of Florida, Denise anchors her love for family and the shoreline into a story that pulsates with adrenaline and emotion. ""I enjoy creating stories that entertain and take my readers to another place, if only for a moment,"" she reflects. Her stories exude an authenticity that only someone who has lived by the sea, understanding its serene beauty and inherent peril, could articulate.
In her writing, Denise cultivates experiences that enchant, enthrall, and excite her readers, allowing them to live vicariously through her dynamically crafted characters. ""My family is first in my life,"" Denise shares, ""and anytime we can get together in the sun, sand, and surf is the best time.""",readwithme

I'm not even sure if you remember me (the German kid who read a lot of English classic literature here back when r/pan was still a thing). Anyway, for this October, I'm planning on reading a very special novel that is pretty much unknown outside of Germany.
The novel in question is a literary adaptation of an old sorbic dark fairytale called ""Krabat"". Don't worry, I got my hands on an English translation of the originally German book - so there won't be any language barrier for anyone.

""Muller may want to get Kemmerich's boots, but this makes him no less involved than someone who does not dare to think about them out of pain. He just knows how to distinguish. If Kemmerich had had any use for these boots, Muller would have run barefoot over the barbed wire rather than racking his brain how to get hold of them.""

there have been no real losses in my life yet, it's hard for me to understand whether a person losing someone close can think about ""boots"". maybe Muller's soul was coarsened in the war? fear for his own life, living through grief more often than a person should experience, have taught him to step over, giving place to thoughts about how he will have to live on his own?

[**Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-5020a2d6a968) is one of the past half-century’s most influential philosophical books. This novel was published in the 1960s, and was written by Robert Pirsig (1928–2017 Robert M. Pirsig), who enrolled at the University of Minnesota at 15, majored in chemistry and became interested in philosophy before traveling to India to study Eastern philosophy. In 1961, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression and was admitted to a mental hospital several times. After his release in 1968, he took his son Chris on a long motorcycle trip. He took his reflections from the trip and wrote this book.  The book’s central theme is to ask what is good, valuable, and quality in the journey. By thinking about the metaphysics of quality and value, it also reflects on how we live today and how to work and live better.

I have a modest shelf of books that were mostly given to me by others, the majority of them sporting bookmarks abandoned about 50 pages in before I lost interest. Most of my books are self-help/psychology books my avid-reader mother has given me (trying to tell me something mom??) or religious books that have been gifted to me. These can be intriguing for a bit, but I don’t believe I have ever finished one. Back in high school my friends used to convince me to read romance novels with them, and I just could never help but roll my eyes over the predictability and cliche of teen romance, or ANOTHER Nicholas Sparks novel set in the Carolina’s.

Have I just not found my genre? It kind of annoyed me when I looked at my bookshelf the other day and realized how few of the books I actually picked out myself. Any recommendations for how to figure out what kind of books I might like? I just did a quick quiz online and it recommended “the city we became” and I am quite intrigued by the description although it looks a bit long for me at 480 pages given my track record.

I can tell you didn’t figure out a way of escaping because you look 100% healthy and I also remember not everyone being here when it happened that’s why I say I don’t know how you escaped but who ever wasn’t as fortunate to escape was left here to suffer.” Merlin asked “what do you mean we never left the school, we do know though one day we went to school and you where not there and we all asked where is Mary but no one new. So now that we are older we decided to find out what happened to you and we went back to school to find out if they was any clues on why you disappeared.” Mary replied “I’m not sure why you, remember staying in school but this was not a school anymore after that day that lady came in and captured the school.” Marlin and Maya looked shocked and confused because that never happened what is she taking about. Then the lady she was talking about came into the room. Mary said “it’s her everyone hide before she gets you.” And Mary rain away. They rain after Mary “Mary come back you’re over reacting.” Mary replied “no I’m not she’ll kill you, Run.” The lady raid after Mary with their favorite childhood book in her  hand  and threw it at her whacking Mary in the head, and down Mary went.” Maya and Marlin rain to Mary to check her out. They put their hands on her chest, and listen to her heart and her breath “she’s not breathing.” The lady started coming towards them. Maya tried grabbing the book from her. She started to bit and pinch Maya, Maya tried pinching her back but she couldn’t for what ever reason she then decided to say while t holding the dragon book “once I was 7 now make me 7 again” she figured she’d say this because she wasn’t as strong as the lady and she Felt like she had more energy at seven years old, to her surprise she went back into time. She had to find out what had happened and fix it. She ran  A-crossed her passed self and asked her “can you help me out. Your family Mary and most the school is in trouble, And if I can’t get the dragon book in your classroom I might not be able to help.” So little Maya got the book off the shelf hiding it form the teacher and gave it to bigger Maya “here you go, now you can save us. I gotta go back to school bye.” So bigger Maya then took a lighter to the book saying “if this brought me back here, this has to be the reason we had are disaster losing half of our students in this school to a which. If I burn it, it should stop everything form happening.” Once the book was finally fully burned Maya vanished in thin air. Little Maya never lose her best friend Mary and all was saved.",readwithme

There are many subgenres for memoir, but so far, I haven't heard of subgenres like thriller or mystery memoir. I find this amazing. Someone, somewhere, must have had (and wrote about) a thrilling or mysterious period in their life, right? I have read some memoirs, such as Maxine Hong Kingston's, ""The Woman Warrior,"" that strike me as having elements of thriller and possibly mystery.

**Ram woke up in a new world as a ghost, with a lifespan of two hours.**

However, he had a system that allowed him to increase his lifespan and also gave him formidable abilities.

The catch? Well, it's nothing sinister -- Just a small requirement to feast on the fear of unsuspecting souls, or eat them outright.

Link : [Devil In Making](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68311/devil-in-making-a-xianxia-litrpg)

Currently has more than 50k words.

**1 chapter per day (1.5k+ words)**

What to expect:

\- While the story primarily focuses on Xianxia elements, it also incorporates elements of Progression Fantasy, Horror, and a System.

\- The protagonist slowly transforms into a villainous (or anti-hero)  character as he adapts to the world around him in order to survive. He is not evil from the start.

\- The plot maintains an equal emphasis on both intricate scheming and intense fight scenes.

\- Expect well-developed side characters with their own individual character arcs.

\- Initially, the story features multiple points of view (POVs), but as the narrative progresses, the number of POVs decreases to maintain a smoother and more focused storytelling experience.",readwithme

1682829587.0,The Unbinding,"Hello! I’m a new writer and just posted the first seven chapter of my book The Unbinding: Rotten to the Roots. The synopsis is as follows: 

Inspector Kint is a simple man. He lives in District 13, a simple district. There is no crime in District 13, which makes his Job a simple Job. Kint likes it when things are simple. They’ve been that way for quite a few years now. When things are simple, Inspector Kint can get along by playing the Curmudgeonly old fool and no one bats an eye.

But in Kaden City, the capital of an empire that spans half the globe, things can become complicated very quickly. Especially when the ambitious Lord Crecius of the Apostle families reaches down from his home in the silver spires of the Ignatium and chooses Kint to be the one to cover up his wretched secrets.

With violence rising for the first time in his tenure, the Church of the Prophet escalating their rhetoric, and an epidemic of sleepless nights pushing the district to its limits, the dangerous game of politics could be the least of Kint’s problems. His days of playing fool may be over. For as Inspector Kint delves into the rotten underbelly of Kaden City, with malicious eyes watching his every move, he’ll have to protect his own secrets as well, and they might be far worse than any Lords…

1681169348.0,Read Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture," The book written by architectural theorist C. Norberg-Schulz reveals that the [relationship between us and the environment is inherently meaningful](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/return-to-the-origin-of-creation-70b3c5b43eaf). When the living place has meaning, people feel “at home.”  The genius loci, an ancient Roman concept, believed that each entity had its soul.  The authenticity of life is an integral part of the genius loci. Lawrence Durrell wrote in 1960.

*“If you want to get to know Europe slowly, taste the wine, cheese, and the characteristics of various rural areas, and you will begin to appreciate that the most important determining factor of any culture is ultimately the spirit of place.”*

 The emergence of alienation in modern society is mainly because modern places provide too few possibilities for direction and identification. The changes in some cities are too drastic, resulting in a complete loss of continuity with the stable essence of the previous place, which leads to a strong sense of alienation in people. However, some historically significant cities such as Prague and Rome have maintained the continuity of the essence of the place in a changing world, thereby providing a better solution to human psychological issues.

Like I mentioned he loves Harry Potter. We have all the original books and the illustrated ones as well. We’re just trying to find more options for him that would still be age appropriate.

As a young entrepreneur, I am always looking for ways to improve people's lives. For a while now, I had an idea I wanted to run by the community. 

Would you be interested in a book journal that can capture what you learned from the book? With categories such as:

\- People, Leadership, Relationships, Goals, life as well as a place to summarize the book and write down quotes?

Backstory:

I, for instance, create a book journal every year for myself (that gets filled pretty fast), which is a lot of work but has helped me so so much in my personal as well as professional life. I only wish there was a book journal I could buy with similar features to the ones mentioned. However, that is not the case which is why I am thinking of producing some myself and selling them.

Is that something you folks would be interested in, or is it a bad idea? 

I would love to hear what you have to say!!

Thank you for your time

1675310011.0,Trying to spark my reading passion again,"I used to be the most avid reader I knew. I would consume 5-6 books in a week. When it came to graphic novels/comics, I was devouring them 3-5 in a day. I had a hunger I was happy to feed and support.

I used to write every day and was inspired by the things I read. I finished my first 500-page novel in fall 2013. I did NaNoWriMo in 2014 for my second novel. If I wasn't working on my main passions/novel I was creating backstories for created characters in video games. Every one of my RPG characters had huge backstories and I sculpted them to hone my skills. I had another side project for writing that was mostly fanfic of my life where I let off steam.

I used to be a lot of things.

The last books I read were in June, a couple of Mira Grant's works. I also enjoyed an audiobook in August.

I'm currently unemployed due to health reasons. Since I'm home all the time I bought some books I've been looking at for years. I wanted to push myself for the 52 book challenge this year. It's not going well.

The book I'm reading is one I should've picked up ten years ago. It's good. Interesting. I want to read more. I want to feel normal again and *read*. It doesn't have to be in crazy volumes. A book a week. Even a book every two weeks.

So I found the perfect time to get some reading time in: physical therapy. A portion of my therapy is sitting in a chair connected to a machine. My first time reading during therapy felt amazing. I was *enjoying* the story. But my second, most recent, time scared me.

I'm in the chair reading, people and patients are around me, and I'm sucked into the story. I felt like I was *in* the book, experiencing what the MC experienced. It was breathtaking. My eyes danced through the lines, absorbing the words and *seeing* the scene. I was so into my book that when my timer went off and I pulled my eyes away, I felt groggy.

I was disoriented and my mind felt fuzzy. One of the therapists that works with me came over, we went over a few things, and I was finished for the day. But as I closed the book and retrieved my things I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. I had been so distracted! What if someone had said my name? Or needed something? I wasn't aware of my surroundings and it freaked me out.

Part of me loved that sensation of becoming a part of what I read. The other was scared of being taken out of reality. I walked out of the building feeling as if on air, wobbly but on a high, I guess?

I want to read this book, finish it, read more books, and have reading closer to my heart like it used to be. I'm wanting my passion back but I feel like I'm holding myself back.

Does anybody else experience anything similar?  How can I ""get back on the horse"" without freaking myself out?",readwithme

Unlike the conventional rhetoric on success: a result of hard work, talent, environment, and luck, *How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big* by **Scott Adams** provides a fresh perspective and practical strategies, revealing that success isn’t magic and has its subtle pattern.

One of the key [insights](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big-a3380a72dd47) is impressive: to see success as math. Your perception of success matters. You’ve put yourself in a passive position when you view it as magic. Yes, we can't control the luck directly, but we can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with better odds. So you should be proactive and adopt some efficient strategy to put you in the right position, allowing luck to find u easily. It's a great point!!",readwithme

In February 2016, an avalanche buried an army post where Lance Naik Koppad was stationed, burying him and nine other soldiers under 25 feet of snow.

Despite being buried for six days, Lance Naik Koppad was miraculously found alive by rescue teams, but he was in critical condition with severe hypothermia and multiple organ failure. He was airlifted to a military hospital in Delhi, where he received extensive medical treatment, but unfortunately, he passed away a few days later.

Lance Naik Koppad's story is a reminder of the sacrifice and bravery of Indian soldiers who serve in some of the most inhospitable and dangerous regions of the world. His story touched the hearts of people across India, and he was hailed as a national hero for his service and sacrifice.

Another story is of Captain Vikram Batra, an officer in the Indian Army who served in the Kargil War in 1999. Captain Batra was known for his bravery and leadership on the battlefield, and he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration for valor, for his actions during the war.

On July 7, 1999, while leading his men in an attack on a heavily fortified enemy position, Captain Batra was critically injured by a grenade. Despite his injuries, he continued to lead his men and was able to capture the enemy position before succumbing to his wounds.

Captain Batra's story is a testament to the selfless bravery and sacrifice of Indian soldiers who defend our country and its people. He and many other brave soldiers like him will always be remembered for their service and sacrifice in the line of duty.",readwithme
1674678959.0,Story From Pakistan,"Once upon a time, there was a man named Malala Yousafzai. She was born in Pakistan in 1997, and from a young age, she was passionate about education and women's rights.

Growing up, Malala attended a school run by her father, where she was one of only a few girls to receive an education. As she grew older, she became increasingly aware of the discrimination and lack of educational opportunities faced by girls in her community, and she began to speak out against it.

In 2008, at the age of 11, Malala wrote a blog for the BBC about her life under the Taliban's rule and their efforts to prevent girls from going to school. Her blog was anonymous, but her identity was later revealed, and it made her a target for the Taliban.

In 2012, Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while she was on her way home from school. She was rushed to a hospital and was in critical condition for a time, but she miraculously survived the attack.

Despite the danger, Malala continued to speak out for education and women's rights. She became an advocate for girls' education and founded the Malala Fund, an organization that works to empower girls through access to education.

In 2014, at the age of 17, Malala became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in promoting education and women's rights. Today she continues to speak out on issues of education and women's rights, and she continues to inspire people around the world to fight for a just and equal society.

Malala's story is a testament to the power of one person's voice and determination to make a difference in the world, and how even in the face of adversity and violence, one can still rise above and make a positive impact.",readwithme

She faced a number of challenges in her life, including poverty, the death of her mother, and a failed marriage. Despite these hardships, she never gave up on her dream of becoming a writer.

One day, while on a train ride, the idea for a story about a young boy attending a school for magic suddenly came to her. She spent the next several years writing and rewriting the story, facing numerous rejections from publishers along the way. But she never gave up.

Finally, in 1997, her book, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"" was accepted for publication. It went on to become one of the best-selling book series of all time, and J.K. Rowling's name became synonymous with success. She had faced many obstacles in her life, but she never gave up on her dream, and ultimately it led her to achieve great success.

1674486823.0,Motivational story of Sarah," 

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah. Sarah was a very determined and ambitious person, but she had always struggled with self-doubt and insecurity. Despite her talents and hard work, she often felt like she wasn't good enough and that she would never be able to achieve her dreams.

One day, Sarah decided that she wanted to become a professional dancer. She worked hard to improve her skills and began to take dance classes every day. But even as she improved, her self-doubt held her back. She was too scared to audition for any dance companies or competitions.

Sarah's dance teacher noticed her struggles and told her about a famous dancer named Misty Copeland. Misty had also faced many obstacles in her career, including being told that she was too old and not the right body type to be a professional ballet dancer. But she didn't let those setbacks hold her back, and she eventually became the first African-American principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre.

Sarah was inspired by Misty's story and realized that she could overcome her own self-doubt. She decided to audition for a local dance company and was thrilled when she got the part. From that moment on, she began to believe in herself and her abilities.

Sarah continued to push herself and eventually landed a spot in a prestigious dance school. She worked hard, and her dedication and hard work paid off when she got a job as a professional dancer.

Years passed and Sarah became a famous dancer, traveling the world and performing in front of thousands of people. She was proud of herself and happy to have overcome her self-doubt and achieved her dream.

Sarah's story shows that with hard work, determination and not giving up on yourself, anyone can achieve their dreams regardless of the setbacks they face. This story is meant to inspire and motivate, that no matter how hard the path may be, with hard work and perseverance, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your dreams.",readwithme

1674388944.0,Overcoming My Fear of Public Speaking,"I remember the first time I had to give a presentation in front of a large group of people. I was in college and had been assigned to give a speech on a topic of my choosing. As soon as I got up to the podium, my heart started racing, my palms were sweating, and my mind went blank. I stumbled through the presentation, my voice shaking and my hands trembling. I was humiliated and couldn't wait for it to be over.

From that day on, I avoided any situation that required public speaking. I would make excuses not to attend meetings or events where I knew I would have to speak in front of others. I even turned down job opportunities because they required me to give presentations.

But as I entered the workforce, I realized that public speaking is an important skill to have in many careers, including mine. I knew that if I wanted to advance in my career, I would have to overcome my fear of public speaking.

So, I decided to take action. I started small, by giving speeches to small groups of friends and family. As I became more comfortable, I gradually increased the size of the audience. I also read books and articles on public speaking, and found a local Toastmasters group where I could practice my skills in a supportive environment.

But the most important thing I did was to face my fear head-on. I signed up to give a presentation at a local conference. I was petrified, but I knew that this was my chance to prove to myself that I could do it. I prepared for weeks, rehearsing my speech and visualizing myself giving it.

On the day of the conference, I was still nervous, but I felt more prepared than ever before. As I walked up to the podium, I felt my nerves dissipate, and I was able to deliver my speech with confidence. I received positive feedback from the audience, and it was one of the most empowering moments of my life.

Now, I am not saying that I never get nervous when I have to speak in public, but I have learned how to manage my nerves and it has become much easier for me. Public speaking is still not my favorite thing to do, but it is no longer something that I fear. I have realized that facing my fears head-on has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. And I would encourage anyone who is struggling with the same fear to do the same.",readwithme
1674388682.0,My Journey to Becoming a Professional Gamer,"When I was a kid, I never could have imagined that playing video games would one day become my career. But that's exactly what happened. My name is Jack and I'm a professional gamer.

It all started when I was in high school. I had always been a big fan of video games, but I never thought of them as more than just a hobby. But one day, a friend introduced me to the world of esports - competitive gaming. I was immediately hooked. I started playing in local tournaments and quickly realized that I had a real talent for the game.

After graduating high school, I decided to take my passion for gaming to the next level. I enrolled in a college with a strong esports program and started to focus on becoming a professional gamer. I spent countless hours practicing, studying strategies, and honing my skills.

It wasn't easy - balancing college coursework with my gaming commitments was a constant struggle. But I knew that if I wanted to succeed in the competitive world of esports, I had to put in the work.

Eventually, all my hard work paid off. I started getting noticed by professional teams and was eventually signed to one of the top teams in the world. I couldn't believe it - I was living my dream of becoming a professional gamer.

But being a professional gamer is not just about playing the game - it's also about being a role model and representative of the team. I have to maintain a good image and conduct myself professionally, as well as to keep my physical and mental health in check.

Since then, I've competed in major tournaments all over the world, and I've even won a few championships. But what I'm most proud of is the impact I've been able to make on the esports community. I've inspired countless young people to pursue their own dreams of becoming professional gamers, and I'm honored to be a part of something that is changing the way the world sees video games.

I know that my journey as a professional gamer is far from over. There will be challenges and setbacks along the way, but I'm excited for what's to come. I'm grateful for the opportunity to do something I love every day and to be able to make a living doing it.

So if you're reading this and you're thinking about pursuing your own dream of becoming a professional gamer, my advice to you is to never give up. Believe in yourself and put in the work, and you'll be surprised at what you can accomplish.",readwithme
1674334570.0,Book ideas to read together with a partner,"Hi! My (28f) partner (30m) gave me a gift for Christmas, a voucher as such, to redeem, and that is he has offered to basically have a little mini book club with me. 

My partner doesn't read, it's not his hobby, but it's definitely one of mine, something I haven't had much time for since having my son, and I'm eager to take this as an opportunity to get back into it.

I'm really looking for ideas of what we could read together, I don't want to pick something as long as The Stand, but I don't want it to be super short either. But also I just don't want him to get bored half way through and give up, because reading isn't his thing. 

Do you think it would be better to read something new to both of us? Or one of my old favourites? And if something new, maybe you could give me some ideas? 

My favourite genres are horror, fantasy and romance, preferably something with all three if I'm honest. My partner strikes me more as a crime thriller vibe, judging by his movie choices over the last few years! I do also really love apocalypse or pandemic stories, The stand is the book I've read most recently that has just really stuck with me, I loved it! 

Any help would be much appreciated!",readwithme

1674235996.0,The Fisherman's luck - An inspirational thought,"**The Fisherman’s luck.**

I genuinely don't know what I'm going to tell you today.

I've tried so many times to think of a great and glamorous incipit, but I still can't think of how to get started. I've been writing it over and over again.

It is known as ""writer's block."" I refer to it as ""fisherman's luck.""

Yes, fisherman’s luck, because ideas are not made, they are found. All you can do is wait like a fisherman patiently waits for a fish to take the bait. Same thing. You sit. You wait. You move around. You wait. You lose your patience. You wait. You lose your hope. You wait. You are just about to give up and then “baam” an idea comes knocking on your door. You smile, you get excited.

But that’s not my story unfortunately.

I know. It sucks; and I promise, I have followed all the guidance, step by step to help an idea come my way. I have waited, my friends… Believe me. I have waited in my room, in the kitchen, by the stairs, on the table, under the table and still… nothing! Not even the most fucking stupid idea has come to me. Nothing!

I feel like I have been left out. I feel like I am the only person in the fucking world who is not capable of coming up with an idea and then doing something good with it. And I hate that feeling! I hate the feeling of not being able to accomplish something while seeing other people succeed. And this is not the first time. 

I hate the feeling of missing out. This is a problem I have been fighting against  since I was a kid. It doesn’t matter what the task is or how many I need to carry out, I still want to make sure that I succeed in all of them, at the same time and with the best outcomes.

I know, you’re going to call me crazy, but this is the devil I have been fighting ever since I can remember: Be the top, be the best, be the bravest, be the number one, be the second to none, be the kindest, be the hero, be the one who saves the world, be yourself, don’t be yourself, be the one in the spotlight, be the one in the corner, be the best friend, be the one who makes more money, be the one that has something to say, be the one that knows when to shut up. Be cool… Be honest. Be arrogant with those who deserve it. Be everywhere. Be nowhere. Just be everything that you can…

BE…

I feel like I have been wearing rugs all my life. I still haven’t found the suit that fits my soul.

 I have no idea who I am, where I am going and what I am looking for.

And with a look on my face like the guy who’s just caught the biggest fish of the day, I stopped and noticed this page is no longer empty. Words have flown in whether I like them or not. 

And such is Life: it goes on regardless of what we think should happen to us.

I salute you my fellow fishermen.",readwithme

1674152176.0,I am able to read books now.,"Ever since young I always hated books, they were boring and picture-less.

I had made an effort to read some but I simply didnt have the attention span and endurance nescessary.

10 years later seems like my problem has been finally fixed in an unexpected way.

For a few years I have been addicted to watching anime, after I ran out of dubbed anime I had to resort to subtitled animes to feed my addiction.

Watching subtitled stuff did hurt my brain at the beggining because I kept having to dart my eyes up and down. but after I got used to it I learned to read using my peripheral vision when the captions were big enough.

Then I decided to watch Saiki Kuso and damn they speak fast, it nearly forced me to double my reading speed to keep up, but its worth it, its the funniest comedy anime ever, go watch it.

The other thing that helped me was getting glasses that actually work, it was hard because no optometrist was able to balance the power of the lenses to reduce strain, but I bought cheap reading glasses from a street vendor and they work much better. 

Now it seems reading is second nature to me and I can do it without paying attention on the text, seems like it frees my mind's eye and now I can simultaneously have a somewhat blurry daydream and read which mean I can daydream what I'm reading as if I was watching it.

Now I finally understand why people read picture-less books, they dont need pictures.",readwithme

I remember he always made remarks in class about how ""some students"" need to start reading more college level books

I'm a very slow reader, reading these books make me happy and they're helping me read a bit better every day, I can now read 1-2 chapters a day (I used to only be able to read 10-15 pages at a time)

Should I really start reading more complex books? (I'm 19yo)

1. Throughout my entire life, reading has been one of my least favorite things to do in my free time. Usually, the only time I read books and stuff like that is when its for a project or an essay for school. Basically what I'm saying is that I usually only read when its a school thing. Recently, I bought a book titled ""Alexander Hamilton"" by Ron Chernow. The one thing different about this book is that its one of the few times I voluntarily bought a book on my own, without it being for school. As mentioned in the title of this post, I don't like reading, but this book really interested me for some reason. I really want to like reading, but I guess an 800 page nonfiction book that uses words way out of my vocab probably wasn't the best choice. I got to page 4/818 and was already wanting to put the book down and never open it again. It was a good book, even though I only got through 4 pages, but that didn't mean I wanted to keep reading. Its just so hard to sit down and read something like that without me wanting to get up and do something more enjoyable. I just really want to like reading, but for someone like me, its just so difficult. I've already thought of things like ""Well maybe I just don't like these types of books"" or ""Maybe I need to try something more interesting like Harry potter."" but even then, I still found that reading was a struggle for me. How do I enjoy reading?!",readwithme

1697065041.0,Press Release,"Dive into a Turbulent Tale of Survival with Denise Ann Stock’s Latest Novel: ""Summer (With Collateral Damage)""
Navigate the eye of the storm and face unforeseen dangers with Denise Ann Stock’s latest pulse-pounding thriller novel, “Summer (With Collateral Damage).” Lauded for inducing heart-pounding terror in its readers, this book is your ticket to an enthralling escape, where the thrill of adventure collides with the raw terror of reality.
Strategic Book Publishing is thrilled to announce the launch of Denise Ann Stock's captivating fourth novel in her acclaimed series, ""Summer (With Collateral Damage),"" where two harrowing threats - one from nature and one man-made - conjoin to forge a heart-stopping narrative.
In this thrilling new release, we journey back with the
Connor Family, this time meeting Alyse Johnson, an
attorney with a quiet beachfront life that is about to be
shaken to its core. Alyse, alongside her friends in the
Connor family, resolves to endure a daunting Category 4
hurricane by barricading themselves in their upscale beach properties. Little do they know, a tempest of another kind—in the form of relentless burglars—sweeps through their abandoned neighborhood, revealing that their greatest test may not be the storm outside but the emerging threat from within. The stormy darkness, while obscuring, lays bare the most vivid of human strengths and frailties.
Lynn Eddy, VP of Acquisitions at Strategic Book Publishing, warns future readers: ""Heart- pounding terror is in store not only for the characters in the book, but for readers as well. Be ready to get scared.""
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" has been distinguished with the prestigious Literary Titan Gold Book Award, an accolade that underscores its rich narrative. Literary Titan praised the novel, expressing that ""Stock does a beautiful job of building an air of mystery,"" lauding the way it engrosses readers by letting their ""imaginations run wild as they wait for the subsequent development.” Alyse Johnson's journey offers a tale where “Romance fans will appreciate the internal struggle"" and ""mystery fans [will find] the thrill they seek.” In bestowing the award, Literary Titan recognizes the intricate plot that holds readers captive but also the emotional depth and thrilling suspense that echo through every chapter.
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" is available now on Kindle and in paperback on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Immerse yourself in a gripping tale that promises to whisk readers into a maelstrom of fear, bravery, and survival.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
    
About the Book
In the luminous world of Alyse Johnson, the tranquility of a privileged beachside existence is mercilessly shattered. This summer, the calm of the Jacksonville Beach is obliterated not just by the cataclysmic fury of a Category 4 hurricane but also by intruders who ruthlessly exploit the chaos, invading the once-peaceful community Alyse calls home.
Locked within the sturdy walls alongside the steadfast Connor family, Alyse isn’t just fighting against the brutal elements outside. As the storm ravages her surroundings, an internal storm of emotions also unfurls as she grapples with turbulent feelings towards Christian, her best friend’s brother and the one person she should stay away from.
Two tempests, external and internal, intertwine to forge a tale where the palpitations of the heart echo the howling of the wind and where every creak and whisper may signify either a clandestine romance or lurking danger.
Will Alyse navigate through these intertwining storms to find peace amidst chaos and love amidst fear?
About the Author
Denise Ann Stock seamlessly meshes her own coastal upbringing with the stormy suspense of her narratives. A native of Huntington Beach, California - the surfing capital of the world - and now nestling in the sandy retreats of Florida, Denise anchors her love for family and the shoreline into a story that pulsates with adrenaline and emotion. ""I enjoy creating stories that entertain and take my readers to another place, if only for a moment,"" she reflects. Her stories exude an authenticity that only someone who has lived by the sea, understanding its serene beauty and inherent peril, could articulate.
In her writing, Denise cultivates experiences that enchant, enthrall, and excite her readers, allowing them to live vicariously through her dynamically crafted characters. ""My family is first in my life,"" Denise shares, ""and anytime we can get together in the sun, sand, and surf is the best time.""",readwithme

1694893768.0,"all quiet on the Western Front, Maria Remarque.","at the beginning of the work, the hero Muller thinks a lot about the boots of his dying friend, it seems more than it should be for a person arriving in grief. but the author describes him as a person who knows how to distinguish.

""Muller may want to get Kemmerich's boots, but this makes him no less involved than someone who does not dare to think about them out of pain. He just knows how to distinguish. If Kemmerich had had any use for these boots, Muller would have run barefoot over the barbed wire rather than racking his brain how to get hold of them.""

there have been no real losses in my life yet, it's hard for me to understand whether a person losing someone close can think about ""boots"". maybe Muller's soul was coarsened in the war? fear for his own life, living through grief more often than a person should experience, have taught him to step over, giving place to thoughts about how he will have to live on his own?

[**Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-5020a2d6a968) is one of the past half-century’s most influential philosophical books. This novel was published in the 1960s, and was written by Robert Pirsig (1928–2017 Robert M. Pirsig), who enrolled at the University of Minnesota at 15, majored in chemistry and became interested in philosophy before traveling to India to study Eastern philosophy. In 1961, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression and was admitted to a mental hospital several times. After his release in 1968, he took his son Chris on a long motorcycle trip. He took his reflections from the trip and wrote this book.  The book’s central theme is to ask what is good, valuable, and quality in the journey. By thinking about the metaphysics of quality and value, it also reflects on how we live today and how to work and live better.

I have a modest shelf of books that were mostly given to me by others, the majority of them sporting bookmarks abandoned about 50 pages in before I lost interest. Most of my books are self-help/psychology books my avid-reader mother has given me (trying to tell me something mom??) or religious books that have been gifted to me. These can be intriguing for a bit, but I don’t believe I have ever finished one. Back in high school my friends used to convince me to read romance novels with them, and I just could never help but roll my eyes over the predictability and cliche of teen romance, or ANOTHER Nicholas Sparks novel set in the Carolina’s.

Have I just not found my genre? It kind of annoyed me when I looked at my bookshelf the other day and realized how few of the books I actually picked out myself. Any recommendations for how to figure out what kind of books I might like? I just did a quick quiz online and it recommended “the city we became” and I am quite intrigued by the description although it looks a bit long for me at 480 pages given my track record.

They liked coming to the circle rug in The center of the classroom to read there favorite book the dragon book. it was a yellow covered book with a purple dragon on it. They played and Learned all day long. 10 years later Maya age 17 now and Marlin age 19 where cuddling next to a tree and thinking about old times and how long they came together and if they even had feelings for each other so Marlin kissed Maya, and Maya kissed Marlin pulled away. “This is weird I just got Mary in my head what ever happened to her I remember her and Half of the school missing in the middle of the year.” May replied “yeah… I do remember that maybe we should go back to the school and try and figure out what happened.” So they walk back to the school only to find out later the school they walk to wasn’t theirs. They walked into the school it looked like there normally school but in fact it wasn’t, they walked down the halls and saw  Mary chain to the chair in the lunchroom they walked up to her and tired to unchain her. They look everywhere to find a A way to free her finally they found the key under a bowl on the kitchen counter of the lunch room, and freed form the chair. “Mary why where you chained up?” They asked Mary replied “I don’t know how you guys manage to escape, but after you all left what ever kids where left her got chained up as prisoners. They died form starvation, beaten to death, or left alone for isolation only to be feed once a day to Servaes like I have. I can tell you didn’t figure out a way of escaping because you look 100% healthy and I also remember not everyone being here when it happened that’s why I say I don’t know how you escaped but who ever wasn’t as fortunate to escape was left here to suffer.” Merlin asked “what do you mean we never left the school, we do know though one day we went to school and you where not there and we all asked where is Mary but no one new. So now that we are older we decided to find out what happened to you and we went back to school to find out if they was any clues on why you disappeared.” Mary replied “I’m not sure why you, remember staying in school but this was not a school anymore after that day that lady came in and captured the school.” Marlin and Maya looked shocked and confused because that never happened what is she taking about. Then the lady she was talking about came into the room. Mary said “it’s her everyone hide before she gets you.” And Mary rain away. They rain after Mary “Mary come back you’re over reacting.” Mary replied “no I’m not she’ll kill you, Run.” The lady raid after Mary with their favorite childhood book in her  hand  and threw it at her whacking Mary in the head, and down Mary went.” Maya and Marlin rain to Mary to check her out. They put their hands on her chest, and listen to her heart and her breath “she’s not breathing.” The lady started coming towards them. Maya tried grabbing the book from her. She started to bit and pinch Maya, Maya tried pinching her back but she couldn’t for what ever reason she then decided to say while t holding the dragon book “once I was 7 now make me 7 again” she figured she’d say this because she wasn’t as strong as the lady and she Felt like she had more energy at seven years old, to her surprise she went back into time. She had to find out what had happened and fix it. She ran  A-crossed her passed self and asked her “can you help me out. Your family Mary and most the school is in trouble, And if I can’t get the dragon book in your classroom I might not be able to help.” So little Maya got the book off the shelf hiding it form the teacher and gave it to bigger Maya “here you go, now you can save us. I gotta go back to school bye.” So bigger Maya then took a lighter to the book saying “if this brought me back here, this has to be the reason we had are disaster losing half of our students in this school to a which. If I burn it, it should stop everything form happening.” Once the book was finally fully burned Maya vanished in thin air. Little Maya never lose her best friend Mary and all was saved.",readwithme

**Ram woke up in a new world as a ghost, with a lifespan of two hours.**

However, he had a system that allowed him to increase his lifespan and also gave him formidable abilities.

The catch? Well, it's nothing sinister -- Just a small requirement to feast on the fear of unsuspecting souls, or eat them outright.

Link : [Devil In Making](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68311/devil-in-making-a-xianxia-litrpg)

Currently has more than 50k words.

**1 chapter per day (1.5k+ words)**

What to expect:

\- While the story primarily focuses on Xianxia elements, it also incorporates elements of Progression Fantasy, Horror, and a System.

\- The protagonist slowly transforms into a villainous (or anti-hero)  character as he adapts to the world around him in order to survive. He is not evil from the start.

\- The plot maintains an equal emphasis on both intricate scheming and intense fight scenes.

\- Expect well-developed side characters with their own individual character arcs.

\- Initially, the story features multiple points of view (POVs), but as the narrative progresses, the number of POVs decreases to maintain a smoother and more focused storytelling experience.",readwithme

1682829587.0,The Unbinding,"Hello! I’m a new writer and just posted the first seven chapter of my book The Unbinding: Rotten to the Roots. The synopsis is as follows: 

Inspector Kint is a simple man. He lives in District 13, a simple district. There is no crime in District 13, which makes his Job a simple Job. Kint likes it when things are simple. They’ve been that way for quite a few years now. When things are simple, Inspector Kint can get along by playing the Curmudgeonly old fool and no one bats an eye.

But in Kaden City, the capital of an empire that spans half the globe, things can become complicated very quickly. Especially when the ambitious Lord Crecius of the Apostle families reaches down from his home in the silver spires of the Ignatium and chooses Kint to be the one to cover up his wretched secrets.

With violence rising for the first time in his tenure, the Church of the Prophet escalating their rhetoric, and an epidemic of sleepless nights pushing the district to its limits, the dangerous game of politics could be the least of Kint’s problems. His days of playing fool may be over. For as Inspector Kint delves into the rotten underbelly of Kaden City, with malicious eyes watching his every move, he’ll have to protect his own secrets as well, and they might be far worse than any Lords…

Something that happens almost all the time is that once i read a page i can barely recall what ive read, and then i go read the page again and it like im reading a whole new page, seeing new sentences etc.

It takes me about 2-3 minutes to read a page in a smaller format book and understand it.

1681169348.0,Read Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture," The book written by architectural theorist C. Norberg-Schulz reveals that the [relationship between us and the environment is inherently meaningful](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/return-to-the-origin-of-creation-70b3c5b43eaf). When the living place has meaning, people feel “at home.”  The genius loci, an ancient Roman concept, believed that each entity had its soul.  The authenticity of life is an integral part of the genius loci. Lawrence Durrell wrote in 1960.

*“If you want to get to know Europe slowly, taste the wine, cheese, and the characteristics of various rural areas, and you will begin to appreciate that the most important determining factor of any culture is ultimately the spirit of place.”*

 The emergence of alienation in modern society is mainly because modern places provide too few possibilities for direction and identification. The changes in some cities are too drastic, resulting in a complete loss of continuity with the stable essence of the previous place, which leads to a strong sense of alienation in people. However, some historically significant cities such as Prague and Rome have maintained the continuity of the essence of the place in a changing world, thereby providing a better solution to human psychological issues.

As a young entrepreneur, I am always looking for ways to improve people's lives. For a while now, I had an idea I wanted to run by the community. 

Would you be interested in a book journal that can capture what you learned from the book? With categories such as:

\- People, Leadership, Relationships, Goals, life as well as a place to summarize the book and write down quotes?

Backstory:

I, for instance, create a book journal every year for myself (that gets filled pretty fast), which is a lot of work but has helped me so so much in my personal as well as professional life. I only wish there was a book journal I could buy with similar features to the ones mentioned. However, that is not the case which is why I am thinking of producing some myself and selling them.

Is that something you folks would be interested in, or is it a bad idea? 

I would love to hear what you have to say!!

Thank you for your time

1675310011.0,Trying to spark my reading passion again,"I used to be the most avid reader I knew. I would consume 5-6 books in a week. When it came to graphic novels/comics, I was devouring them 3-5 in a day. I had a hunger I was happy to feed and support.

I used to write every day and was inspired by the things I read. I finished my first 500-page novel in fall 2013. I did NaNoWriMo in 2014 for my second novel. If I wasn't working on my main passions/novel I was creating backstories for created characters in video games. Every one of my RPG characters had huge backstories and I sculpted them to hone my skills. I had another side project for writing that was mostly fanfic of my life where I let off steam.

I used to be a lot of things.

The last books I read were in June, a couple of Mira Grant's works. I also enjoyed an audiobook in August.

I'm currently unemployed due to health reasons. Since I'm home all the time I bought some books I've been looking at for years. I wanted to push myself for the 52 book challenge this year. It's not going well.

The book I'm reading is one I should've picked up ten years ago. It's good. Interesting. I want to read more. I want to feel normal again and *read*. It doesn't have to be in crazy volumes. A book a week. Even a book every two weeks.

So I found the perfect time to get some reading time in: physical therapy. A portion of my therapy is sitting in a chair connected to a machine. My first time reading during therapy felt amazing. I was *enjoying* the story. But my second, most recent, time scared me.

I'm in the chair reading, people and patients are around me, and I'm sucked into the story. I felt like I was *in* the book, experiencing what the MC experienced. It was breathtaking. My eyes danced through the lines, absorbing the words and *seeing* the scene. I was so into my book that when my timer went off and I pulled my eyes away, I felt groggy.

I was disoriented and my mind felt fuzzy. One of the therapists that works with me came over, we went over a few things, and I was finished for the day. But as I closed the book and retrieved my things I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. I had been so distracted! What if someone had said my name? Or needed something? I wasn't aware of my surroundings and it freaked me out.

Part of me loved that sensation of becoming a part of what I read. The other was scared of being taken out of reality. I walked out of the building feeling as if on air, wobbly but on a high, I guess?

I want to read this book, finish it, read more books, and have reading closer to my heart like it used to be. I'm wanting my passion back but I feel like I'm holding myself back.

Does anybody else experience anything similar?  How can I ""get back on the horse"" without freaking myself out?",readwithme

Unlike the conventional rhetoric on success: a result of hard work, talent, environment, and luck, *How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big* by **Scott Adams** provides a fresh perspective and practical strategies, revealing that success isn’t magic and has its subtle pattern.

One of the key [insights](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big-a3380a72dd47) is impressive: to see success as math. Your perception of success matters. You’ve put yourself in a passive position when you view it as magic. Yes, we can't control the luck directly, but we can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with better odds. So you should be proactive and adopt some efficient strategy to put you in the right position, allowing luck to find u easily. It's a great point!!",readwithme

In February 2016, an avalanche buried an army post where Lance Naik Koppad was stationed, burying him and nine other soldiers under 25 feet of snow.

Despite being buried for six days, Lance Naik Koppad was miraculously found alive by rescue teams, but he was in critical condition with severe hypothermia and multiple organ failure. He was airlifted to a military hospital in Delhi, where he received extensive medical treatment, but unfortunately, he passed away a few days later.

Lance Naik Koppad's story is a reminder of the sacrifice and bravery of Indian soldiers who serve in some of the most inhospitable and dangerous regions of the world. His story touched the hearts of people across India, and he was hailed as a national hero for his service and sacrifice.

Another story is of Captain Vikram Batra, an officer in the Indian Army who served in the Kargil War in 1999. Captain Batra was known for his bravery and leadership on the battlefield, and he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration for valor, for his actions during the war.

On July 7, 1999, while leading his men in an attack on a heavily fortified enemy position, Captain Batra was critically injured by a grenade. Despite his injuries, he continued to lead his men and was able to capture the enemy position before succumbing to his wounds.

Growing up, Malala attended a school run by her father, where she was one of only a few girls to receive an education. As she grew older, she became increasingly aware of the discrimination and lack of educational opportunities faced by girls in her community, and she began to speak out against it.

In 2008, at the age of 11, Malala wrote a blog for the BBC about her life under the Taliban's rule and their efforts to prevent girls from going to school. Her blog was anonymous, but her identity was later revealed, and it made her a target for the Taliban.

In 2012, Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while she was on her way home from school. She was rushed to a hospital and was in critical condition for a time, but she miraculously survived the attack.

Despite the danger, Malala continued to speak out for education and women's rights. She became an advocate for girls' education and founded the Malala Fund, an organization that works to empower girls through access to education.

In 2014, at the age of 17, Malala became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in promoting education and women's rights. Today she continues to speak out on issues of education and women's rights, and she continues to inspire people around the world to fight for a just and equal society.

1674486823.0,Motivational story of Sarah," 

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah. Sarah was a very determined and ambitious person, but she had always struggled with self-doubt and insecurity. Despite her talents and hard work, she often felt like she wasn't good enough and that she would never be able to achieve her dreams.

One day, Sarah decided that she wanted to become a professional dancer. She worked hard to improve her skills and began to take dance classes every day. But even as she improved, her self-doubt held her back. She was too scared to audition for any dance companies or competitions.

Sarah's dance teacher noticed her struggles and told her about a famous dancer named Misty Copeland. Misty had also faced many obstacles in her career, including being told that she was too old and not the right body type to be a professional ballet dancer. But she didn't let those setbacks hold her back, and she eventually became the first African-American principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre.

Sarah was inspired by Misty's story and realized that she could overcome her own self-doubt. She decided to audition for a local dance company and was thrilled when she got the part. From that moment on, she began to believe in herself and her abilities.

Sarah continued to push herself and eventually landed a spot in a prestigious dance school. She worked hard, and her dedication and hard work paid off when she got a job as a professional dancer.

Years passed and Sarah became a famous dancer, traveling the world and performing in front of thousands of people. She was proud of herself and happy to have overcome her self-doubt and achieved her dream.

Sarah's story shows that with hard work, determination and not giving up on yourself, anyone can achieve their dreams regardless of the setbacks they face. This story is meant to inspire and motivate, that no matter how hard the path may be, with hard work and perseverance, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your dreams.",readwithme

1674388944.0,Overcoming My Fear of Public Speaking,"I remember the first time I had to give a presentation in front of a large group of people. I was in college and had been assigned to give a speech on a topic of my choosing. As soon as I got up to the podium, my heart started racing, my palms were sweating, and my mind went blank. I stumbled through the presentation, my voice shaking and my hands trembling. I was humiliated and couldn't wait for it to be over.

From that day on, I avoided any situation that required public speaking. I would make excuses not to attend meetings or events where I knew I would have to speak in front of others. I even turned down job opportunities because they required me to give presentations.

But as I entered the workforce, I realized that public speaking is an important skill to have in many careers, including mine. I knew that if I wanted to advance in my career, I would have to overcome my fear of public speaking.

So, I decided to take action. I started small, by giving speeches to small groups of friends and family. As I became more comfortable, I gradually increased the size of the audience. I also read books and articles on public speaking, and found a local Toastmasters group where I could practice my skills in a supportive environment.

But the most important thing I did was to face my fear head-on. I signed up to give a presentation at a local conference. I was petrified, but I knew that this was my chance to prove to myself that I could do it. I prepared for weeks, rehearsing my speech and visualizing myself giving it.

On the day of the conference, I was still nervous, but I felt more prepared than ever before. As I walked up to the podium, I felt my nerves dissipate, and I was able to deliver my speech with confidence. I received positive feedback from the audience, and it was one of the most empowering moments of my life.

Now, I am not saying that I never get nervous when I have to speak in public, but I have learned how to manage my nerves and it has become much easier for me. Public speaking is still not my favorite thing to do, but it is no longer something that I fear. I have realized that facing my fears head-on has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. And I would encourage anyone who is struggling with the same fear to do the same.",readwithme
1674388682.0,My Journey to Becoming a Professional Gamer,"When I was a kid, I never could have imagined that playing video games would one day become my career. But that's exactly what happened. My name is Jack and I'm a professional gamer.

It all started when I was in high school. I had always been a big fan of video games, but I never thought of them as more than just a hobby. But one day, a friend introduced me to the world of esports - competitive gaming. I was immediately hooked. I started playing in local tournaments and quickly realized that I had a real talent for the game.

After graduating high school, I decided to take my passion for gaming to the next level. I enrolled in a college with a strong esports program and started to focus on becoming a professional gamer. I spent countless hours practicing, studying strategies, and honing my skills.

It wasn't easy - balancing college coursework with my gaming commitments was a constant struggle. But I knew that if I wanted to succeed in the competitive world of esports, I had to put in the work.

Eventually, all my hard work paid off. I started getting noticed by professional teams and was eventually signed to one of the top teams in the world. I couldn't believe it - I was living my dream of becoming a professional gamer.

But being a professional gamer is not just about playing the game - it's also about being a role model and representative of the team. I have to maintain a good image and conduct myself professionally, as well as to keep my physical and mental health in check.

Since then, I've competed in major tournaments all over the world, and I've even won a few championships. But what I'm most proud of is the impact I've been able to make on the esports community. I've inspired countless young people to pursue their own dreams of becoming professional gamers, and I'm honored to be a part of something that is changing the way the world sees video games.

I know that my journey as a professional gamer is far from over. There will be challenges and setbacks along the way, but I'm excited for what's to come. I'm grateful for the opportunity to do something I love every day and to be able to make a living doing it.

So if you're reading this and you're thinking about pursuing your own dream of becoming a professional gamer, my advice to you is to never give up. Believe in yourself and put in the work, and you'll be surprised at what you can accomplish.",readwithme
1674334570.0,Book ideas to read together with a partner,"Hi! My (28f) partner (30m) gave me a gift for Christmas, a voucher as such, to redeem, and that is he has offered to basically have a little mini book club with me. 

My partner doesn't read, it's not his hobby, but it's definitely one of mine, something I haven't had much time for since having my son, and I'm eager to take this as an opportunity to get back into it.

I'm really looking for ideas of what we could read together, I don't want to pick something as long as The Stand, but I don't want it to be super short either. But also I just don't want him to get bored half way through and give up, because reading isn't his thing. 

Do you think it would be better to read something new to both of us? Or one of my old favourites? And if something new, maybe you could give me some ideas? 

My favourite genres are horror, fantasy and romance, preferably something with all three if I'm honest. My partner strikes me more as a crime thriller vibe, judging by his movie choices over the last few years! I do also really love apocalypse or pandemic stories, The stand is the book I've read most recently that has just really stuck with me, I loved it! 

Any help would be much appreciated!",readwithme

1674235996.0,The Fisherman's luck - An inspirational thought,"**The Fisherman’s luck.**

I genuinely don't know what I'm going to tell you today.

I've tried so many times to think of a great and glamorous incipit, but I still can't think of how to get started. I've been writing it over and over again.

It is known as ""writer's block."" I refer to it as ""fisherman's luck.""

Yes, fisherman’s luck, because ideas are not made, they are found. All you can do is wait like a fisherman patiently waits for a fish to take the bait. Same thing. You sit. You wait. You move around. You wait. You lose your patience. You wait. You lose your hope. You wait. You are just about to give up and then “baam” an idea comes knocking on your door. You smile, you get excited.

But that’s not my story unfortunately.

I know. It sucks; and I promise, I have followed all the guidance, step by step to help an idea come my way. I have waited, my friends… Believe me. I have waited in my room, in the kitchen, by the stairs, on the table, under the table and still… nothing! Not even the most fucking stupid idea has come to me. Nothing!

I feel like I have been left out. I feel like I am the only person in the fucking world who is not capable of coming up with an idea and then doing something good with it. And I hate that feeling! I hate the feeling of not being able to accomplish something while seeing other people succeed. And this is not the first time. 

I hate the feeling of missing out. This is a problem I have been fighting against  since I was a kid. It doesn’t matter what the task is or how many I need to carry out, I still want to make sure that I succeed in all of them, at the same time and with the best outcomes.

I know, you’re going to call me crazy, but this is the devil I have been fighting ever since I can remember: Be the top, be the best, be the bravest, be the number one, be the second to none, be the kindest, be the hero, be the one who saves the world, be yourself, don’t be yourself, be the one in the spotlight, be the one in the corner, be the best friend, be the one who makes more money, be the one that has something to say, be the one that knows when to shut up. Be cool… Be honest. Be arrogant with those who deserve it. Be everywhere. Be nowhere. Just be everything that you can…

BE…

I feel like I have been wearing rugs all my life. I still haven’t found the suit that fits my soul.

 I have no idea who I am, where I am going and what I am looking for.

And with a look on my face like the guy who’s just caught the biggest fish of the day, I stopped and noticed this page is no longer empty. Words have flown in whether I like them or not. 

And such is Life: it goes on regardless of what we think should happen to us.

I salute you my fellow fishermen.",readwithme

1674152176.0,I am able to read books now.,"Ever since young I always hated books, they were boring and picture-less.

I had made an effort to read some but I simply didnt have the attention span and endurance nescessary.

10 years later seems like my problem has been finally fixed in an unexpected way.

For a few years I have been addicted to watching anime, after I ran out of dubbed anime I had to resort to subtitled animes to feed my addiction.

Watching subtitled stuff did hurt my brain at the beggining because I kept having to dart my eyes up and down. but after I got used to it I learned to read using my peripheral vision when the captions were big enough.

Then I decided to watch Saiki Kuso and damn they speak fast, it nearly forced me to double my reading speed to keep up, but its worth it, its the funniest comedy anime ever, go watch it.

The other thing that helped me was getting glasses that actually work, it was hard because no optometrist was able to balance the power of the lenses to reduce strain, but I bought cheap reading glasses from a street vendor and they work much better. 

Now it seems reading is second nature to me and I can do it without paying attention on the text, seems like it frees my mind's eye and now I can simultaneously have a somewhat blurry daydream and read which mean I can daydream what I'm reading as if I was watching it.

Now I finally understand why people read picture-less books, they dont need pictures.",readwithme

Usually I don't even think about it, cuz I personally don't care, but once in a while I just remember what my English teacher said

I remember he always made remarks in class about how ""some students"" need to start reading more college level books

I'm a very slow reader, reading these books make me happy and they're helping me read a bit better every day, I can now read 1-2 chapters a day (I used to only be able to read 10-15 pages at a time)

Should I really start reading more complex books? (I'm 19yo)

Just joined and wanted to introduce myself. I'm Daniel (D.K. Hansen). I love to read and always end up in the fantasy genre because of the epic world building, magic, rogues and mythical creatures. But in 2019 I found the passion for writing my own stories when I discovered a few chapters I wrote back in 2014. From there I drafted a plot, characters, and began building the world of Elonia. And then I was hooked. It has grown ever since with my first book, Jarren Heartwood, released in 2021 and my second book, The Omen of Destruction, releasing later this year.

Eventually he know he has to be honest with you and confess to you he’s been watching you from day one. How would you react?

1672826971.0,"They say we're past ""social media"" and are now in the age of algorithms: the ""recommendation media.""","With everything that’s happening in the social media space right now — Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter and the subsequent layoff that followed, Meta’s mass layoffs and $36 billion gamble on the metaverse that has yet to yield results, and the earlier collective negative reaction to Instagram’s new algorithm — it’s easy to say that the once darling of the internet has lost its luster, some might even say it’s already dead, or at least on the way there.

But if we look at similar events in the social media timeline — from the rise and fall of Friendster, MySpace, Google+, Tumblr, Vine and many others that walked the same path — the space and all those in it are probably just changing. But what is it changing into?

Here, the main mode of content distribution is no longer users’ network or social graph. Instead, content is shared through centralised algorithms.

I recently started doing live readings on stream (Reading Worm by Wildbow) and now I'm doing a separate sleepy series where I'll read stuff with background noise like cracking fireplaces etc etc to help people fall asleep! 

 Would appreciate if you guys checked it out and will happily take any feedback!

ALL VODs on YT, Live stuff probably on Twitch!

I've always wanted to read LOTR, but always ended up dropping it because of school/work etc. Now I'm quite eager to make it through this time, so please feel free to join me! Archived VODs will stay on my YT too! (Be prepared to hear random thoughts and rambling while I figure out positions and layouts of things haha)

1637552784.0,How do I like reading?,"&#x200B;

1. Throughout my entire life, reading has been one of my least favorite things to do in my free time. Usually, the only time I read books and stuff like that is when its for a project or an essay for school. Basically what I'm saying is that I usually only read when its a school thing. Recently, I bought a book titled ""Alexander Hamilton"" by Ron Chernow. The one thing different about this book is that its one of the few times I voluntarily bought a book on my own, without it being for school. As mentioned in the title of this post, I don't like reading, but this book really interested me for some reason. I really want to like reading, but I guess an 800 page nonfiction book that uses words way out of my vocab probably wasn't the best choice. I got to page 4/818 and was already wanting to put the book down and never open it again. It was a good book, even though I only got through 4 pages, but that didn't mean I wanted to keep reading. Its just so hard to sit down and read something like that without me wanting to get up and do something more enjoyable. I just really want to like reading, but for someone like me, its just so difficult. I've already thought of things like ""Well maybe I just don't like these types of books"" or ""Maybe I need to try something more interesting like Harry potter."" but even then, I still found that reading was a struggle for me. How do I enjoy reading?!",readwithme

1697065041.0,Press Release,"Dive into a Turbulent Tale of Survival with Denise Ann Stock’s Latest Novel: ""Summer (With Collateral Damage)""
Navigate the eye of the storm and face unforeseen dangers with Denise Ann Stock’s latest pulse-pounding thriller novel, “Summer (With Collateral Damage).” Lauded for inducing heart-pounding terror in its readers, this book is your ticket to an enthralling escape, where the thrill of adventure collides with the raw terror of reality.
Strategic Book Publishing is thrilled to announce the launch of Denise Ann Stock's captivating fourth novel in her acclaimed series, ""Summer (With Collateral Damage),"" where two harrowing threats - one from nature and one man-made - conjoin to forge a heart-stopping narrative.
In this thrilling new release, we journey back with the
Connor Family, this time meeting Alyse Johnson, an
attorney with a quiet beachfront life that is about to be
shaken to its core. Alyse, alongside her friends in the
Connor family, resolves to endure a daunting Category 4
hurricane by barricading themselves in their upscale beach properties. Little do they know, a tempest of another kind—in the form of relentless burglars—sweeps through their abandoned neighborhood, revealing that their greatest test may not be the storm outside but the emerging threat from within. The stormy darkness, while obscuring, lays bare the most vivid of human strengths and frailties.
Lynn Eddy, VP of Acquisitions at Strategic Book Publishing, warns future readers: ""Heart- pounding terror is in store not only for the characters in the book, but for readers as well. Be ready to get scared.""
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" has been distinguished with the prestigious Literary Titan Gold Book Award, an accolade that underscores its rich narrative. Literary Titan praised the novel, expressing that ""Stock does a beautiful job of building an air of mystery,"" lauding the way it engrosses readers by letting their ""imaginations run wild as they wait for the subsequent development.” Alyse Johnson's journey offers a tale where “Romance fans will appreciate the internal struggle"" and ""mystery fans [will find] the thrill they seek.” In bestowing the award, Literary Titan recognizes the intricate plot that holds readers captive but also the emotional depth and thrilling suspense that echo through every chapter.
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" is available now on Kindle and in paperback on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Immerse yourself in a gripping tale that promises to whisk readers into a maelstrom of fear, bravery, and survival.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
    
About the Book
In the luminous world of Alyse Johnson, the tranquility of a privileged beachside existence is mercilessly shattered. This summer, the calm of the Jacksonville Beach is obliterated not just by the cataclysmic fury of a Category 4 hurricane but also by intruders who ruthlessly exploit the chaos, invading the once-peaceful community Alyse calls home.
Locked within the sturdy walls alongside the steadfast Connor family, Alyse isn’t just fighting against the brutal elements outside. As the storm ravages her surroundings, an internal storm of emotions also unfurls as she grapples with turbulent feelings towards Christian, her best friend’s brother and the one person she should stay away from.
Two tempests, external and internal, intertwine to forge a tale where the palpitations of the heart echo the howling of the wind and where every creak and whisper may signify either a clandestine romance or lurking danger.
Will Alyse navigate through these intertwining storms to find peace amidst chaos and love amidst fear?
About the Author
Denise Ann Stock seamlessly meshes her own coastal upbringing with the stormy suspense of her narratives. A native of Huntington Beach, California - the surfing capital of the world - and now nestling in the sandy retreats of Florida, Denise anchors her love for family and the shoreline into a story that pulsates with adrenaline and emotion. ""I enjoy creating stories that entertain and take my readers to another place, if only for a moment,"" she reflects. Her stories exude an authenticity that only someone who has lived by the sea, understanding its serene beauty and inherent peril, could articulate.
In her writing, Denise cultivates experiences that enchant, enthrall, and excite her readers, allowing them to live vicariously through her dynamically crafted characters. ""My family is first in my life,"" Denise shares, ""and anytime we can get together in the sun, sand, and surf is the best time.""",readwithme

If Kemmerich had had any use for these boots, Muller would have run barefoot over the barbed wire rather than racking his brain how to get hold of them.""

there have been no real losses in my life yet, it's hard for me to understand whether a person losing someone close can think about ""boots"". maybe Muller's soul was coarsened in the war? fear for his own life, living through grief more often than a person should experience, have taught him to step over, giving place to thoughts about how he will have to live on his own?

[Robert Pirsig and his son Chris](https://preview.redd.it/2jug6uihf6fb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=411db2bb25a81d7059410abfde3df4af99e83259)

[**Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-5020a2d6a968) is one of the past half-century’s most influential philosophical books. This novel was published in the 1960s, and was written by Robert Pirsig (1928–2017 Robert M. Pirsig), who enrolled at the University of Minnesota at 15, majored in chemistry and became interested in philosophy before traveling to India to study Eastern philosophy. In 1961, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression and was admitted to a mental hospital several times. After his release in 1968, he took his son Chris on a long motorcycle trip. He took his reflections from the trip and wrote this book.  The book’s central theme is to ask what is good, valuable, and quality in the journey. By thinking about the metaphysics of quality and value, it also reflects on how we live today and how to work and live better.

1690254919.0,Is reading not my thing or have I just not found my genre?,"I (26F) have always liked to read, but I’ve never really made time for it and so I have always thought of myself as someone who just isn’t much of a reader. I have a modest shelf of books that were mostly given to me by others, the majority of them sporting bookmarks abandoned about 50 pages in before I lost interest. Most of my books are self-help/psychology books my avid-reader mother has given me (trying to tell me something mom??) or religious books that have been gifted to me. These can be intriguing for a bit, but I don’t believe I have ever finished one. Back in high school my friends used to convince me to read romance novels with them, and I just could never help but roll my eyes over the predictability and cliche of teen romance, or ANOTHER Nicholas Sparks novel set in the Carolina’s.

Have I just not found my genre? It kind of annoyed me when I looked at my bookshelf the other day and realized how few of the books I actually picked out myself. Any recommendations for how to figure out what kind of books I might like? I just did a quick quiz online and it recommended “the city we became” and I am quite intrigued by the description although it looks a bit long for me at 480 pages given my track record.

They liked coming to the circle rug in The center of the classroom to read there favorite book the dragon book. it was a yellow covered book with a purple dragon on it. They played and Learned all day long. 10 years later Maya age 17 now and Marlin age 19 where cuddling next to a tree and thinking about old times and how long they came together and if they even had feelings for each other so Marlin kissed Maya, and Maya kissed Marlin pulled away. “This is weird I just got Mary in my head what ever happened to her I remember her and Half of the school missing in the middle of the year.” May replied “yeah… I do remember that maybe we should go back to the school and try and figure out what happened.” So they walk back to the school only to find out later the school they walk to wasn’t theirs. They walked into the school it looked like there normally school but in fact it wasn’t, they walked down the halls and saw  Mary chain to the chair in the lunchroom they walked up to her and tired to unchain her. They look everywhere to find a A way to free her finally they found the key under a bowl on the kitchen counter of the lunch room, and freed form the chair. “Mary why where you chained up?” They asked Mary replied “I don’t know how you guys manage to escape, but after you all left what ever kids where left her got chained up as prisoners. They died form starvation, beaten to death, or left alone for isolation only to be feed once a day to Servaes like I have. I can tell you didn’t figure out a way of escaping because you look 100% healthy and I also remember not everyone being here when it happened that’s why I say I don’t know how you escaped but who ever wasn’t as fortunate to escape was left here to suffer.” Merlin asked “what do you mean we never left the school, we do know though one day we went to school and you where not there and we all asked where is Mary but no one new. So now that we are older we decided to find out what happened to you and we went back to school to find out if they was any clues on why you disappeared.” Mary replied “I’m not sure why you, remember staying in school but this was not a school anymore after that day that lady came in and captured the school.” Marlin and Maya looked shocked and confused because that never happened what is she taking about. Then the lady she was talking about came into the room. Mary said “it’s her everyone hide before she gets you.” And Mary rain away. They rain after Mary “Mary come back you’re over reacting.” Mary replied “no I’m not she’ll kill you, Run.” The lady raid after Mary with their favorite childhood book in her  hand  and threw it at her whacking Mary in the head, and down Mary went.” Maya and Marlin rain to Mary to check her out. They put their hands on her chest, and listen to her heart and her breath “she’s not breathing.” The lady started coming towards them. Maya tried grabbing the book from her. She started to bit and pinch Maya, Maya tried pinching her back but she couldn’t for what ever reason she then decided to say while t holding the dragon book “once I was 7 now make me 7 again” she figured she’d say this because she wasn’t as strong as the lady and she Felt like she had more energy at seven years old, to her surprise she went back into time. She had to find out what had happened and fix it. She ran  A-crossed her passed self and asked her “can you help me out. Your family Mary and most the school is in trouble, And if I can’t get the dragon book in your classroom I might not be able to help.” So little Maya got the book off the shelf hiding it form the teacher and gave it to bigger Maya “here you go, now you can save us. I gotta go back to school bye.” So bigger Maya then took a lighter to the book saying “if this brought me back here, this has to be the reason we had are disaster losing half of our students in this school to a which.

**Ram woke up in a new world as a ghost, with a lifespan of two hours.**

However, he had a system that allowed him to increase his lifespan and also gave him formidable abilities.

The catch? Well, it's nothing sinister -- Just a small requirement to feast on the fear of unsuspecting souls, or eat them outright.

Link : [Devil In Making](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68311/devil-in-making-a-xianxia-litrpg)

Currently has more than 50k words.

**1 chapter per day (1.5k+ words)**

What to expect:

\- While the story primarily focuses on Xianxia elements, it also incorporates elements of Progression Fantasy, Horror, and a System.

\- The protagonist slowly transforms into a villainous (or anti-hero)  character as he adapts to the world around him in order to survive. He is not evil from the start.

\- The plot maintains an equal emphasis on both intricate scheming and intense fight scenes.

\- Expect well-developed side characters with their own individual character arcs.

\- Initially, the story features multiple points of view (POVs), but as the narrative progresses, the number of POVs decreases to maintain a smoother and more focused storytelling experience.",readwithme

1682829587.0,The Unbinding,"Hello! I’m a new writer and just posted the first seven chapter of my book The Unbinding: Rotten to the Roots. The synopsis is as follows: 

Inspector Kint is a simple man. He lives in District 13, a simple district. There is no crime in District 13, which makes his Job a simple Job. Kint likes it when things are simple. They’ve been that way for quite a few years now. When things are simple, Inspector Kint can get along by playing the Curmudgeonly old fool and no one bats an eye.

But in Kaden City, the capital of an empire that spans half the globe, things can become complicated very quickly. Especially when the ambitious Lord Crecius of the Apostle families reaches down from his home in the silver spires of the Ignatium and chooses Kint to be the one to cover up his wretched secrets.

With violence rising for the first time in his tenure, the Church of the Prophet escalating their rhetoric, and an epidemic of sleepless nights pushing the district to its limits, the dangerous game of politics could be the least of Kint’s problems. His days of playing fool may be over. For as Inspector Kint delves into the rotten underbelly of Kaden City, with malicious eyes watching his every move, he’ll have to protect his own secrets as well, and they might be far worse than any Lords…

Something that happens almost all the time is that once i read a page i can barely recall what ive read, and then i go read the page again and it like im reading a whole new page, seeing new sentences etc.

It takes me about 2-3 minutes to read a page in a smaller format book and understand it.

1681169348.0,Read Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture," The book written by architectural theorist C. Norberg-Schulz reveals that the [relationship between us and the environment is inherently meaningful](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/return-to-the-origin-of-creation-70b3c5b43eaf). When the living place has meaning, people feel “at home.”  The genius loci, an ancient Roman concept, believed that each entity had its soul.  The authenticity of life is an integral part of the genius loci. Lawrence Durrell wrote in 1960.

*“If you want to get to know Europe slowly, taste the wine, cheese, and the characteristics of various rural areas, and you will begin to appreciate that the most important determining factor of any culture is ultimately the spirit of place.”*

 The emergence of alienation in modern society is mainly because modern places provide too few possibilities for direction and identification. The changes in some cities are too drastic, resulting in a complete loss of continuity with the stable essence of the previous place, which leads to a strong sense of alienation in people. However, some historically significant cities such as Prague and Rome have maintained the continuity of the essence of the place in a changing world, thereby providing a better solution to human psychological issues.

As a young entrepreneur, I am always looking for ways to improve people's lives. For a while now, I had an idea I wanted to run by the community. 

Would you be interested in a book journal that can capture what you learned from the book? With categories such as:

\- People, Leadership, Relationships, Goals, life as well as a place to summarize the book and write down quotes?

Backstory:

I, for instance, create a book journal every year for myself (that gets filled pretty fast), which is a lot of work but has helped me so so much in my personal as well as professional life. I only wish there was a book journal I could buy with similar features to the ones mentioned. However, that is not the case which is why I am thinking of producing some myself and selling them.

Is that something you folks would be interested in, or is it a bad idea?

1675310011.0,Trying to spark my reading passion again,"I used to be the most avid reader I knew. I would consume 5-6 books in a week. When it came to graphic novels/comics, I was devouring them 3-5 in a day. I had a hunger I was happy to feed and support.

I used to write every day and was inspired by the things I read. I finished my first 500-page novel in fall 2013. I did NaNoWriMo in 2014 for my second novel. If I wasn't working on my main passions/novel I was creating backstories for created characters in video games. Every one of my RPG characters had huge backstories and I sculpted them to hone my skills. I had another side project for writing that was mostly fanfic of my life where I let off steam.

I used to be a lot of things.

The last books I read were in June, a couple of Mira Grant's works. I also enjoyed an audiobook in August.

I'm currently unemployed due to health reasons. Since I'm home all the time I bought some books I've been looking at for years. I wanted to push myself for the 52 book challenge this year. It's not going well.

The book I'm reading is one I should've picked up ten years ago. It's good. Interesting. I want to read more. I want to feel normal again and *read*. It doesn't have to be in crazy volumes. A book a week. Even a book every two weeks.

So I found the perfect time to get some reading time in: physical therapy. A portion of my therapy is sitting in a chair connected to a machine. My first time reading during therapy felt amazing. I was *enjoying* the story. But my second, most recent, time scared me.

I'm in the chair reading, people and patients are around me, and I'm sucked into the story. I felt like I was *in* the book, experiencing what the MC experienced. It was breathtaking. My eyes danced through the lines, absorbing the words and *seeing* the scene. I was so into my book that when my timer went off and I pulled my eyes away, I felt groggy.

I was disoriented and my mind felt fuzzy. One of the therapists that works with me came over, we went over a few things, and I was finished for the day. But as I closed the book and retrieved my things I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. I had been so distracted! What if someone had said my name? Or needed something? I wasn't aware of my surroundings and it freaked me out.

Part of me loved that sensation of becoming a part of what I read. The other was scared of being taken out of reality. I walked out of the building feeling as if on air, wobbly but on a high, I guess?

I want to read this book, finish it, read more books, and have reading closer to my heart like it used to be. I'm wanting my passion back but I feel like I'm holding myself back.

Does anybody else experience anything similar?  How can I ""get back on the horse"" without freaking myself out?",readwithme

Unlike the conventional rhetoric on success: a result of hard work, talent, environment, and luck, *How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big* by **Scott Adams** provides a fresh perspective and practical strategies, revealing that success isn’t magic and has its subtle pattern.

One of the key [insights](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big-a3380a72dd47) is impressive: to see success as math. Your perception of success matters. You’ve put yourself in a passive position when you view it as magic. Yes, we can't control the luck directly, but we can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with better odds. So you should be proactive and adopt some efficient strategy to put you in the right position, allowing luck to find u easily. It's a great point!!",readwithme

In February 2016, an avalanche buried an army post where Lance Naik Koppad was stationed, burying him and nine other soldiers under 25 feet of snow.

Despite being buried for six days, Lance Naik Koppad was miraculously found alive by rescue teams, but he was in critical condition with severe hypothermia and multiple organ failure. He was airlifted to a military hospital in Delhi, where he received extensive medical treatment, but unfortunately, he passed away a few days later.

Lance Naik Koppad's story is a reminder of the sacrifice and bravery of Indian soldiers who serve in some of the most inhospitable and dangerous regions of the world. His story touched the hearts of people across India, and he was hailed as a national hero for his service and sacrifice.

Another story is of Captain Vikram Batra, an officer in the Indian Army who served in the Kargil War in 1999. Captain Batra was known for his bravery and leadership on the battlefield, and he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration for valor, for his actions during the war.

On July 7, 1999, while leading his men in an attack on a heavily fortified enemy position, Captain Batra was critically injured by a grenade. Despite his injuries, he continued to lead his men and was able to capture the enemy position before succumbing to his wounds.

Captain Batra's story is a testament to the selfless bravery and sacrifice of Indian soldiers who defend our country and its people. He and many other brave soldiers like him will always be remembered for their service and sacrifice in the line of duty.",readwithme
1674678959.0,Story From Pakistan,"Once upon a time, there was a man named Malala Yousafzai. She was born in Pakistan in 1997, and from a young age, she was passionate about education and women's rights.

Growing up, Malala attended a school run by her father, where she was one of only a few girls to receive an education. As she grew older, she became increasingly aware of the discrimination and lack of educational opportunities faced by girls in her community, and she began to speak out against it.

In 2008, at the age of 11, Malala wrote a blog for the BBC about her life under the Taliban's rule and their efforts to prevent girls from going to school. Her blog was anonymous, but her identity was later revealed, and it made her a target for the Taliban.

In 2012, Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while she was on her way home from school. She was rushed to a hospital and was in critical condition for a time, but she miraculously survived the attack.

Despite the danger, Malala continued to speak out for education and women's rights. She became an advocate for girls' education and founded the Malala Fund, an organization that works to empower girls through access to education.

In 2014, at the age of 17, Malala became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in promoting education and women's rights. Today she continues to speak out on issues of education and women's rights, and she continues to inspire people around the world to fight for a just and equal society.

She faced a number of challenges in her life, including poverty, the death of her mother, and a failed marriage. Despite these hardships, she never gave up on her dream of becoming a writer.

One day, while on a train ride, the idea for a story about a young boy attending a school for magic suddenly came to her. She spent the next several years writing and rewriting the story, facing numerous rejections from publishers along the way. But she never gave up.

1674486823.0,Motivational story of Sarah," 

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah. Sarah was a very determined and ambitious person, but she had always struggled with self-doubt and insecurity. Despite her talents and hard work, she often felt like she wasn't good enough and that she would never be able to achieve her dreams.

One day, Sarah decided that she wanted to become a professional dancer. She worked hard to improve her skills and began to take dance classes every day. But even as she improved, her self-doubt held her back. She was too scared to audition for any dance companies or competitions.

Sarah's dance teacher noticed her struggles and told her about a famous dancer named Misty Copeland. Misty had also faced many obstacles in her career, including being told that she was too old and not the right body type to be a professional ballet dancer. But she didn't let those setbacks hold her back, and she eventually became the first African-American principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre.

Sarah was inspired by Misty's story and realized that she could overcome her own self-doubt. She decided to audition for a local dance company and was thrilled when she got the part. From that moment on, she began to believe in herself and her abilities.

Sarah continued to push herself and eventually landed a spot in a prestigious dance school. She worked hard, and her dedication and hard work paid off when she got a job as a professional dancer.

Years passed and Sarah became a famous dancer, traveling the world and performing in front of thousands of people. She was proud of herself and happy to have overcome her self-doubt and achieved her dream.

Sarah's story shows that with hard work, determination and not giving up on yourself, anyone can achieve their dreams regardless of the setbacks they face. This story is meant to inspire and motivate, that no matter how hard the path may be, with hard work and perseverance, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your dreams.",readwithme

1674388944.0,Overcoming My Fear of Public Speaking,"I remember the first time I had to give a presentation in front of a large group of people. I was in college and had been assigned to give a speech on a topic of my choosing. As soon as I got up to the podium, my heart started racing, my palms were sweating, and my mind went blank. I stumbled through the presentation, my voice shaking and my hands trembling. I was humiliated and couldn't wait for it to be over.

From that day on, I avoided any situation that required public speaking. I would make excuses not to attend meetings or events where I knew I would have to speak in front of others. I even turned down job opportunities because they required me to give presentations.

But as I entered the workforce, I realized that public speaking is an important skill to have in many careers, including mine. I knew that if I wanted to advance in my career, I would have to overcome my fear of public speaking.

So, I decided to take action. I started small, by giving speeches to small groups of friends and family. As I became more comfortable, I gradually increased the size of the audience. I also read books and articles on public speaking, and found a local Toastmasters group where I could practice my skills in a supportive environment.

But the most important thing I did was to face my fear head-on. I signed up to give a presentation at a local conference. I was petrified, but I knew that this was my chance to prove to myself that I could do it. I prepared for weeks, rehearsing my speech and visualizing myself giving it.

On the day of the conference, I was still nervous, but I felt more prepared than ever before. As I walked up to the podium, I felt my nerves dissipate, and I was able to deliver my speech with confidence. I received positive feedback from the audience, and it was one of the most empowering moments of my life.

Now, I am not saying that I never get nervous when I have to speak in public, but I have learned how to manage my nerves and it has become much easier for me. Public speaking is still not my favorite thing to do, but it is no longer something that I fear. I have realized that facing my fears head-on has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. And I would encourage anyone who is struggling with the same fear to do the same.",readwithme
1674388682.0,My Journey to Becoming a Professional Gamer,"When I was a kid, I never could have imagined that playing video games would one day become my career. But that's exactly what happened. My name is Jack and I'm a professional gamer.

It all started when I was in high school. I had always been a big fan of video games, but I never thought of them as more than just a hobby. But one day, a friend introduced me to the world of esports - competitive gaming. I was immediately hooked. I started playing in local tournaments and quickly realized that I had a real talent for the game.

After graduating high school, I decided to take my passion for gaming to the next level. I enrolled in a college with a strong esports program and started to focus on becoming a professional gamer. I spent countless hours practicing, studying strategies, and honing my skills.

It wasn't easy - balancing college coursework with my gaming commitments was a constant struggle. But I knew that if I wanted to succeed in the competitive world of esports, I had to put in the work.

Eventually, all my hard work paid off. I started getting noticed by professional teams and was eventually signed to one of the top teams in the world. I couldn't believe it - I was living my dream of becoming a professional gamer.

But being a professional gamer is not just about playing the game - it's also about being a role model and representative of the team. I have to maintain a good image and conduct myself professionally, as well as to keep my physical and mental health in check.

Since then, I've competed in major tournaments all over the world, and I've even won a few championships. But what I'm most proud of is the impact I've been able to make on the esports community. I've inspired countless young people to pursue their own dreams of becoming professional gamers, and I'm honored to be a part of something that is changing the way the world sees video games.

I know that my journey as a professional gamer is far from over. There will be challenges and setbacks along the way, but I'm excited for what's to come. I'm grateful for the opportunity to do something I love every day and to be able to make a living doing it.

So if you're reading this and you're thinking about pursuing your own dream of becoming a professional gamer, my advice to you is to never give up. Believe in yourself and put in the work, and you'll be surprised at what you can accomplish.",readwithme
1674334570.0,Book ideas to read together with a partner,"Hi! My (28f) partner (30m) gave me a gift for Christmas, a voucher as such, to redeem, and that is he has offered to basically have a little mini book club with me. 

My partner doesn't read, it's not his hobby, but it's definitely one of mine, something I haven't had much time for since having my son, and I'm eager to take this as an opportunity to get back into it.

I'm really looking for ideas of what we could read together, I don't want to pick something as long as The Stand, but I don't want it to be super short either. But also I just don't want him to get bored half way through and give up, because reading isn't his thing. 

Do you think it would be better to read something new to both of us? Or one of my old favourites? And if something new, maybe you could give me some ideas? 

My favourite genres are horror, fantasy and romance, preferably something with all three if I'm honest. My partner strikes me more as a crime thriller vibe, judging by his movie choices over the last few years! I do also really love apocalypse or pandemic stories, The stand is the book I've read most recently that has just really stuck with me, I loved it!

1674235996.0,The Fisherman's luck - An inspirational thought,"**The Fisherman’s luck.**

I genuinely don't know what I'm going to tell you today.

I've tried so many times to think of a great and glamorous incipit, but I still can't think of how to get started. I've been writing it over and over again.

It is known as ""writer's block."" I refer to it as ""fisherman's luck.""

Yes, fisherman’s luck, because ideas are not made, they are found. All you can do is wait like a fisherman patiently waits for a fish to take the bait. Same thing. You sit. You wait. You move around. You wait. You lose your patience. You wait. You lose your hope. You wait. You are just about to give up and then “baam” an idea comes knocking on your door. You smile, you get excited.

But that’s not my story unfortunately.

I know. It sucks; and I promise, I have followed all the guidance, step by step to help an idea come my way. I have waited, my friends… Believe me. I have waited in my room, in the kitchen, by the stairs, on the table, under the table and still… nothing! Not even the most fucking stupid idea has come to me. Nothing!

I feel like I have been left out. I feel like I am the only person in the fucking world who is not capable of coming up with an idea and then doing something good with it. And I hate that feeling! I hate the feeling of not being able to accomplish something while seeing other people succeed. And this is not the first time. 

I hate the feeling of missing out. This is a problem I have been fighting against  since I was a kid. It doesn’t matter what the task is or how many I need to carry out, I still want to make sure that I succeed in all of them, at the same time and with the best outcomes.

I know, you’re going to call me crazy, but this is the devil I have been fighting ever since I can remember: Be the top, be the best, be the bravest, be the number one, be the second to none, be the kindest, be the hero, be the one who saves the world, be yourself, don’t be yourself, be the one in the spotlight, be the one in the corner, be the best friend, be the one who makes more money, be the one that has something to say, be the one that knows when to shut up. Be cool… Be honest. Be arrogant with those who deserve it. Be everywhere. Be nowhere. Just be everything that you can…

BE…

I feel like I have been wearing rugs all my life. I still haven’t found the suit that fits my soul.

 I have no idea who I am, where I am going and what I am looking for.

And with a look on my face like the guy who’s just caught the biggest fish of the day, I stopped and noticed this page is no longer empty. Words have flown in whether I like them or not. 

And such is Life: it goes on regardless of what we think should happen to us.

I salute you my fellow fishermen.",readwithme

1674152176.0,I am able to read books now.,"Ever since young I always hated books, they were boring and picture-less.

I had made an effort to read some but I simply didnt have the attention span and endurance nescessary.

10 years later seems like my problem has been finally fixed in an unexpected way.

For a few years I have been addicted to watching anime, after I ran out of dubbed anime I had to resort to subtitled animes to feed my addiction.

Watching subtitled stuff did hurt my brain at the beggining because I kept having to dart my eyes up and down. but after I got used to it I learned to read using my peripheral vision when the captions were big enough.

Then I decided to watch Saiki Kuso and damn they speak fast, it nearly forced me to double my reading speed to keep up, but its worth it, its the funniest comedy anime ever, go watch it.

The other thing that helped me was getting glasses that actually work, it was hard because no optometrist was able to balance the power of the lenses to reduce strain, but I bought cheap reading glasses from a street vendor and they work much better. 

Now it seems reading is second nature to me and I can do it without paying attention on the text, seems like it frees my mind's eye and now I can simultaneously have a somewhat blurry daydream and read which mean I can daydream what I'm reading as if I was watching it.

Now I finally understand why people read picture-less books, they dont need pictures.",readwithme
1674095921.0,"I feel ""childish"" about the books I read, any advice?","I've always read young-adult/teenage fiction, and never more ""serious"" books like my classmates

Usually I don't even think about it, cuz I personally don't care, but once in a while I just remember what my English teacher said

I remember he always made remarks in class about how ""some students"" need to start reading more college level books

I'm a very slow reader, reading these books make me happy and they're helping me read a bit better every day, I can now read 1-2 chapters a day (I used to only be able to read 10-15 pages at a time)

Should I really start reading more complex books? (I'm 19yo)

Edit: thank you everyone for the reassurance, I forgot to mention the fact that English is my second language, so that's another reason why I struggle to read ""complex"" books, even reading Harry Potter I have to stop every other page to search a word",readwithme

1. From consuming information to creating meaningful things
2. Don’t capture information without purpose.
3. Building your second brain needs efficient methods (like the CODE method) to standardize how to capture, organize and distill information. It’s the key to improving the productivity of using information.

Just joined and wanted to introduce myself. I'm Daniel (D.K. Hansen). I love to read and always end up in the fantasy genre because of the epic world building, magic, rogues and mythical creatures. But in 2019 I found the passion for writing my own stories when I discovered a few chapters I wrote back in 2014. From there I drafted a plot, characters, and began building the world of Elonia. And then I was hooked. It has grown ever since with my first book, Jarren Heartwood, released in 2021 and my second book, The Omen of Destruction, releasing later this year.

Hello fellow readers! I’d like to ask for your opinion about a scene in a novel I’m writing. 

How would you react about the following:

He is a lycan prince, and he is your soulmate. He felt your soul awaken the moment you were born but knew he had to wait for you to come of age to get into your life. But he wanted you, he couldn’t stay away from you and needed to know you were safe, so he’s been watching you. 

Eventually he know he has to be honest with you and confess to you he’s been watching you from day one. How would you react?

Have into consideration that at this point, you know who and what he is. You love him and can’t imagine a life without him, after all, he is your soulmate, and you’ve been waiting for the love of your life since the age you started getting interested in dating.",readwithme

1672826971.0,"They say we're past ""social media"" and are now in the age of algorithms: the ""recommendation media.""","With everything that’s happening in the social media space right now — Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter and the subsequent layoff that followed, Meta’s mass layoffs and $36 billion gamble on the metaverse that has yet to yield results, and the earlier collective negative reaction to Instagram’s new algorithm — it’s easy to say that the once darling of the internet has lost its luster, some might even say it’s already dead, or at least on the way there.

But if we look at similar events in the social media timeline — from the rise and fall of Friendster, MySpace, Google+, Tumblr, Vine and many others that walked the same path — the space and all those in it are probably just changing. But what is it changing into? For some pundits, it’s transforming into what he calls the “[recommendation media.](https://medium.com/blockchain-biz/recommendation-media-is-here-but-is-it-what-we-need-a5564609e03c)”

Here, the main mode of content distribution is no longer users’ network or social graph. Instead, content is shared through centralised algorithms.

1. Throughout my entire life, reading has been one of my least favorite things to do in my free time. Usually, the only time I read books and stuff like that is when its for a project or an essay for school. Basically what I'm saying is that I usually only read when its a school thing. Recently, I bought a book titled ""Alexander Hamilton"" by Ron Chernow. The one thing different about this book is that its one of the few times I voluntarily bought a book on my own, without it being for school. As mentioned in the title of this post, I don't like reading, but this book really interested me for some reason. I really want to like reading, but I guess an 800 page nonfiction book that uses words way out of my vocab probably wasn't the best choice. I got to page 4/818 and was already wanting to put the book down and never open it again. It was a good book, even though I only got through 4 pages, but that didn't mean I wanted to keep reading. Its just so hard to sit down and read something like that without me wanting to get up and do something more enjoyable. I just really want to like reading, but for someone like me, its just so difficult. I've already thought of things like ""Well maybe I just don't like these types of books"" or ""Maybe I need to try something more interesting like Harry potter."" but even then, I still found that reading was a struggle for me. How do I enjoy reading?!",readwithme

1697065041.0,Press Release,"Dive into a Turbulent Tale of Survival with Denise Ann Stock’s Latest Novel: ""Summer (With Collateral Damage)""
Navigate the eye of the storm and face unforeseen dangers with Denise Ann Stock’s latest pulse-pounding thriller novel, “Summer (With Collateral Damage).” Lauded for inducing heart-pounding terror in its readers, this book is your ticket to an enthralling escape, where the thrill of adventure collides with the raw terror of reality.
Strategic Book Publishing is thrilled to announce the launch of Denise Ann Stock's captivating fourth novel in her acclaimed series, ""Summer (With Collateral Damage),"" where two harrowing threats - one from nature and one man-made - conjoin to forge a heart-stopping narrative.
In this thrilling new release, we journey back with the
Connor Family, this time meeting Alyse Johnson, an
attorney with a quiet beachfront life that is about to be
shaken to its core. Alyse, alongside her friends in the
Connor family, resolves to endure a daunting Category 4
hurricane by barricading themselves in their upscale beach properties. Little do they know, a tempest of another kind—in the form of relentless burglars—sweeps through their abandoned neighborhood, revealing that their greatest test may not be the storm outside but the emerging threat from within. The stormy darkness, while obscuring, lays bare the most vivid of human strengths and frailties.
Lynn Eddy, VP of Acquisitions at Strategic Book Publishing, warns future readers: ""Heart- pounding terror is in store not only for the characters in the book, but for readers as well. Be ready to get scared.""
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" has been distinguished with the prestigious Literary Titan Gold Book Award, an accolade that underscores its rich narrative. Literary Titan praised the novel, expressing that ""Stock does a beautiful job of building an air of mystery,"" lauding the way it engrosses readers by letting their ""imaginations run wild as they wait for the subsequent development.” Alyse Johnson's journey offers a tale where “Romance fans will appreciate the internal struggle"" and ""mystery fans [will find] the thrill they seek.” In bestowing the award, Literary Titan recognizes the intricate plot that holds readers captive but also the emotional depth and thrilling suspense that echo through every chapter.
""Summer (With Collateral Damage)"" is available now on Kindle and in paperback on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Immerse yourself in a gripping tale that promises to whisk readers into a maelstrom of fear, bravery, and survival.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
    
About the Book
In the luminous world of Alyse Johnson, the tranquility of a privileged beachside existence is mercilessly shattered. This summer, the calm of the Jacksonville Beach is obliterated not just by the cataclysmic fury of a Category 4 hurricane but also by intruders who ruthlessly exploit the chaos, invading the once-peaceful community Alyse calls home.
Locked within the sturdy walls alongside the steadfast Connor family, Alyse isn’t just fighting against the brutal elements outside. As the storm ravages her surroundings, an internal storm of emotions also unfurls as she grapples with turbulent feelings towards Christian, her best friend’s brother and the one person she should stay away from.
Two tempests, external and internal, intertwine to forge a tale where the palpitations of the heart echo the howling of the wind and where every creak and whisper may signify either a clandestine romance or lurking danger.
Will Alyse navigate through these intertwining storms to find peace amidst chaos and love amidst fear?
About the Author
Denise Ann Stock seamlessly meshes her own coastal upbringing with the stormy suspense of her narratives. A native of Huntington Beach, California - the surfing capital of the world - and now nestling in the sandy retreats of Florida, Denise anchors her love for family and the shoreline into a story that pulsates with adrenaline and emotion. ""I enjoy creating stories that entertain and take my readers to another place, if only for a moment,"" she reflects. Her stories exude an authenticity that only someone who has lived by the sea, understanding its serene beauty and inherent peril, could articulate.
In her writing, Denise cultivates experiences that enchant, enthrall, and excite her readers, allowing them to live vicariously through her dynamically crafted characters.

there have been no real losses in my life yet, it's hard for me to understand whether a person losing someone close can think about ""boots"". maybe Muller's soul was coarsened in the war? fear for his own life, living through grief more often than a person should experience, have taught him to step over, giving place to thoughts about how he will have to live on his own?

[**Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-5020a2d6a968) is one of the past half-century’s most influential philosophical books. This novel was published in the 1960s, and was written by Robert Pirsig (1928–2017 Robert M. Pirsig), who enrolled at the University of Minnesota at 15, majored in chemistry and became interested in philosophy before traveling to India to study Eastern philosophy. In 1961, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression and was admitted to a mental hospital several times. After his release in 1968, he took his son Chris on a long motorcycle trip. He took his reflections from the trip and wrote this book.  The book’s central theme is to ask what is good, valuable, and quality in the journey. By thinking about the metaphysics of quality and value, it also reflects on how we live today and how to work and live better.

I have a modest shelf of books that were mostly given to me by others, the majority of them sporting bookmarks abandoned about 50 pages in before I lost interest. Most of my books are self-help/psychology books my avid-reader mother has given me (trying to tell me something mom??) or religious books that have been gifted to me. These can be intriguing for a bit, but I don’t believe I have ever finished one. Back in high school my friends used to convince me to read romance novels with them, and I just could never help but roll my eyes over the predictability and cliche of teen romance, or ANOTHER Nicholas Sparks novel set in the Carolina’s.

Have I just not found my genre? It kind of annoyed me when I looked at my bookshelf the other day and realized how few of the books I actually picked out myself. Any recommendations for how to figure out what kind of books I might like?

Now, as an almost well established adult, I see it as a story of solitude. Every character is alone and lonely and they all have different coping mechanisms to fill the emptiness they feel. 
It’s also a story of grief. The grief of losing a friend, a loved one, yourself…

They played and Learned all day long. 10 years later Maya age 17 now and Marlin age 19 where cuddling next to a tree and thinking about old times and how long they came together and if they even had feelings for each other so Marlin kissed Maya, and Maya kissed Marlin pulled away. “This is weird I just got Mary in my head what ever happened to her I remember her and Half of the school missing in the middle of the year.” May replied “yeah… I do remember that maybe we should go back to the school and try and figure out what happened.” So they walk back to the school only to find out later the school they walk to wasn’t theirs. They walked into the school it looked like there normally school but in fact it wasn’t, they walked down the halls and saw  Mary chain to the chair in the lunchroom they walked up to her and tired to unchain her. They look everywhere to find a A way to free her finally they found the key under a bowl on the kitchen counter of the lunch room, and freed form the chair. “Mary why where you chained up?” They asked Mary replied “I don’t know how you guys manage to escape, but after you all left what ever kids where left her got chained up as prisoners. They died form starvation, beaten to death, or left alone for isolation only to be feed once a day to Servaes like I have. I can tell you didn’t figure out a way of escaping because you look 100% healthy and I also remember not everyone being here when it happened that’s why I say I don’t know how you escaped but who ever wasn’t as fortunate to escape was left here to suffer.” Merlin asked “what do you mean we never left the school, we do know though one day we went to school and you where not there and we all asked where is Mary but no one new. So now that we are older we decided to find out what happened to you and we went back to school to find out if they was any clues on why you disappeared.” Mary replied “I’m not sure why you, remember staying in school but this was not a school anymore after that day that lady came in and captured the school.” Marlin and Maya looked shocked and confused because that never happened what is she taking about. Then the lady she was talking about came into the room. Mary said “it’s her everyone hide before she gets you.” And Mary rain away. They rain after Mary “Mary come back you’re over reacting.” Mary replied “no I’m not she’ll kill you, Run.” The lady raid after Mary with their favorite childhood book in her  hand  and threw it at her whacking Mary in the head, and down Mary went.” Maya and Marlin rain to Mary to check her out. They put their hands on her chest, and listen to her heart and her breath “she’s not breathing.” The lady started coming towards them. Maya tried grabbing the book from her. She started to bit and pinch Maya, Maya tried pinching her back but she couldn’t for what ever reason she then decided to say while t holding the dragon book “once I was 7 now make me 7 again” she figured she’d say this because she wasn’t as strong as the lady and she Felt like she had more energy at seven years old, to her surprise she went back into time. She had to find out what had happened and fix it. She ran  A-crossed her passed self and asked her “can you help me out. Your family Mary and most the school is in trouble, And if I can’t get the dragon book in your classroom I might not be able to help.” So little Maya got the book off the shelf hiding it form the teacher and gave it to bigger Maya “here you go, now you can save us. I gotta go back to school bye.” So bigger Maya then took a lighter to the book saying “if this brought me back here, this has to be the reason we had are disaster losing half of our students in this school to a which. If I burn it, it should stop everything form happening.” Once the book was finally fully burned Maya vanished in thin air. Little Maya never lose her best friend Mary and all was saved.",readwithme

**Ram woke up in a new world as a ghost, with a lifespan of two hours.**

However, he had a system that allowed him to increase his lifespan and also gave him formidable abilities.

The catch? Well, it's nothing sinister -- Just a small requirement to feast on the fear of unsuspecting souls, or eat them outright.

Link : [Devil In Making](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68311/devil-in-making-a-xianxia-litrpg)

Currently has more than 50k words.

**1 chapter per day (1.5k+ words)**

What to expect:

\- While the story primarily focuses on Xianxia elements, it also incorporates elements of Progression Fantasy, Horror, and a System.

\- The protagonist slowly transforms into a villainous (or anti-hero)  character as he adapts to the world around him in order to survive. He is not evil from the start.

\- The plot maintains an equal emphasis on both intricate scheming and intense fight scenes.

\- Expect well-developed side characters with their own individual character arcs.

\- Initially, the story features multiple points of view (POVs), but as the narrative progresses, the number of POVs decreases to maintain a smoother and more focused storytelling experience.",readwithme

Inspector Kint is a simple man. He lives in District 13, a simple district. There is no crime in District 13, which makes his Job a simple Job. Kint likes it when things are simple. They’ve been that way for quite a few years now. When things are simple, Inspector Kint can get along by playing the Curmudgeonly old fool and no one bats an eye.

But in Kaden City, the capital of an empire that spans half the globe, things can become complicated very quickly. Especially when the ambitious Lord Crecius of the Apostle families reaches down from his home in the silver spires of the Ignatium and chooses Kint to be the one to cover up his wretched secrets.

With violence rising for the first time in his tenure, the Church of the Prophet escalating their rhetoric, and an epidemic of sleepless nights pushing the district to its limits, the dangerous game of politics could be the least of Kint’s problems. His days of playing fool may be over. For as Inspector Kint delves into the rotten underbelly of Kaden City, with malicious eyes watching his every move, he’ll have to protect his own secrets as well, and they might be far worse than any Lords…

I wanna get into it now since i guess i grew up and finally got interested in it. The problem is that its very hard to stay focused while reading, i constantly zone out.

Something that happens almost all the time is that once i read a page i can barely recall what ive read, and then i go read the page again and it like im reading a whole new page, seeing new sentences etc.

It takes me about 2-3 minutes to read a page in a smaller format book and understand it.

Currently trying to read Crime and Punishment by Dostojevski.

Id be very grateful if i got some advice because its very frustrating and its making me rethink my decision.",readwithme

1681169348.0,Read Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture," The book written by architectural theorist C. Norberg-Schulz reveals that the [relationship between us and the environment is inherently meaningful](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/return-to-the-origin-of-creation-70b3c5b43eaf). When the living place has meaning, people feel “at home.”  The genius loci, an ancient Roman concept, believed that each entity had its soul.  The authenticity of life is an integral part of the genius loci. Lawrence Durrell wrote in 1960.

*“If you want to get to know Europe slowly, taste the wine, cheese, and the characteristics of various rural areas, and you will begin to appreciate that the most important determining factor of any culture is ultimately the spirit of place.”*

 The emergence of alienation in modern society is mainly because modern places provide too few possibilities for direction and identification. The changes in some cities are too drastic, resulting in a complete loss of continuity with the stable essence of the previous place, which leads to a strong sense of alienation in people. However, some historically significant cities such as Prague and Rome have maintained the continuity of the essence of the place in a changing world, thereby providing a better solution to human psychological issues.

Like I mentioned he loves Harry Potter. We have all the original books and the illustrated ones as well. We’re just trying to find more options for him that would still be age appropriate.

As a young entrepreneur, I am always looking for ways to improve people's lives. For a while now, I had an idea I wanted to run by the community. 

Would you be interested in a book journal that can capture what you learned from the book? With categories such as:

\- People, Leadership, Relationships, Goals, life as well as a place to summarize the book and write down quotes?

Backstory:

I, for instance, create a book journal every year for myself (that gets filled pretty fast), which is a lot of work but has helped me so so much in my personal as well as professional life. I only wish there was a book journal I could buy with similar features to the ones mentioned. However, that is not the case which is why I am thinking of producing some myself and selling them.

Is that something you folks would be interested in, or is it a bad idea? 

I would love to hear what you have to say!!

I think something like V E Schwab's Vicious, ExtraOrdinary and Vengeful but with mystery and thriller. Imagine The Boys and probably Invincible.

1675310011.0,Trying to spark my reading passion again,"I used to be the most avid reader I knew. I would consume 5-6 books in a week. When it came to graphic novels/comics, I was devouring them 3-5 in a day. I had a hunger I was happy to feed and support.

I used to write every day and was inspired by the things I read. I finished my first 500-page novel in fall 2013. I did NaNoWriMo in 2014 for my second novel. If I wasn't working on my main passions/novel I was creating backstories for created characters in video games. Every one of my RPG characters had huge backstories and I sculpted them to hone my skills. I had another side project for writing that was mostly fanfic of my life where I let off steam.

I used to be a lot of things.

The last books I read were in June, a couple of Mira Grant's works. I also enjoyed an audiobook in August.

I'm currently unemployed due to health reasons. Since I'm home all the time I bought some books I've been looking at for years. I wanted to push myself for the 52 book challenge this year. It's not going well.

The book I'm reading is one I should've picked up ten years ago. It's good. Interesting. I want to read more. I want to feel normal again and *read*. It doesn't have to be in crazy volumes. A book a week. Even a book every two weeks.

So I found the perfect time to get some reading time in: physical therapy. A portion of my therapy is sitting in a chair connected to a machine. My first time reading during therapy felt amazing. I was *enjoying* the story. But my second, most recent, time scared me.

I'm in the chair reading, people and patients are around me, and I'm sucked into the story. I felt like I was *in* the book, experiencing what the MC experienced. It was breathtaking. My eyes danced through the lines, absorbing the words and *seeing* the scene. I was so into my book that when my timer went off and I pulled my eyes away, I felt groggy.

I was disoriented and my mind felt fuzzy. One of the therapists that works with me came over, we went over a few things, and I was finished for the day. But as I closed the book and retrieved my things I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. I had been so distracted! What if someone had said my name? Or needed something? I wasn't aware of my surroundings and it freaked me out.

Part of me loved that sensation of becoming a part of what I read. The other was scared of being taken out of reality. I walked out of the building feeling as if on air, wobbly but on a high, I guess?

I want to read this book, finish it, read more books, and have reading closer to my heart like it used to be. I'm wanting my passion back but I feel like I'm holding myself back.

Does anybody else experience anything similar?  How can I ""get back on the horse"" without freaking myself out?",readwithme

Unlike the conventional rhetoric on success: a result of hard work, talent, environment, and luck, *How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big* by **Scott Adams** provides a fresh perspective and practical strategies, revealing that success isn’t magic and has its subtle pattern.

One of the key [insights](https://beautyofcreation.medium.com/reading-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big-a3380a72dd47) is impressive: to see success as math. Your perception of success matters. You’ve put yourself in a passive position when you view it as magic. Yes, we can't control the luck directly, but we can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with better odds. So you should be proactive and adopt some efficient strategy to put you in the right position, allowing luck to find u easily. It's a great point!!",readwithme

1674679145.0,Bravery of Indian Soldiers,"One such story is that of Lance Naik Hanumanthappa Koppad, a soldier in the Indian Army who served in the Siachen Glacier region. In February 2016, an avalanche buried an army post where Lance Naik Koppad was stationed, burying him and nine other soldiers under 25 feet of snow.

Despite being buried for six days, Lance Naik Koppad was miraculously found alive by rescue teams, but he was in critical condition with severe hypothermia and multiple organ failure. He was airlifted to a military hospital in Delhi, where he received extensive medical treatment, but unfortunately, he passed away a few days later.

Lance Naik Koppad's story is a reminder of the sacrifice and bravery of Indian soldiers who serve in some of the most inhospitable and dangerous regions of the world. His story touched the hearts of people across India, and he was hailed as a national hero for his service and sacrifice.

Another story is of Captain Vikram Batra, an officer in the Indian Army who served in the Kargil War in 1999. Captain Batra was known for his bravery and leadership on the battlefield, and he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration for valor, for his actions during the war.

On July 7, 1999, while leading his men in an attack on a heavily fortified enemy position, Captain Batra was critically injured by a grenade. Despite his injuries, he continued to lead his men and was able to capture the enemy position before succumbing to his wounds.

Captain Batra's story is a testament to the selfless bravery and sacrifice of Indian soldiers who defend our country and its people. He and many other brave soldiers like him will always be remembered for their service and sacrifice in the line of duty.",readwithme
1674678959.0,Story From Pakistan,"Once upon a time, there was a man named Malala Yousafzai. She was born in Pakistan in 1997, and from a young age, she was passionate about education and women's rights.

Growing up, Malala attended a school run by her father, where she was one of only a few girls to receive an education. As she grew older, she became increasingly aware of the discrimination and lack of educational opportunities faced by girls in her community, and she began to speak out against it.

In 2008, at the age of 11, Malala wrote a blog for the BBC about her life under the Taliban's rule and their efforts to prevent girls from going to school. Her blog was anonymous, but her identity was later revealed, and it made her a target for the Taliban.

In 2012, Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while she was on her way home from school. She was rushed to a hospital and was in critical condition for a time, but she miraculously survived the attack.

Despite the danger, Malala continued to speak out for education and women's rights. She became an advocate for girls' education and founded the Malala Fund, an organization that works to empower girls through access to education.

In 2014, at the age of 17, Malala became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in promoting education and women's rights. Today she continues to speak out on issues of education and women's rights, and she continues to inspire people around the world to fight for a just and equal society.

She faced a number of challenges in her life, including poverty, the death of her mother, and a failed marriage. Despite these hardships, she never gave up on her dream of becoming a writer.

One day, while on a train ride, the idea for a story about a young boy attending a school for magic suddenly came to her. She spent the next several years writing and rewriting the story, facing numerous rejections from publishers along the way. But she never gave up.

1674486823.0,Motivational story of Sarah," 

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah. Sarah was a very determined and ambitious person, but she had always struggled with self-doubt and insecurity. Despite her talents and hard work, she often felt like she wasn't good enough and that she would never be able to achieve her dreams.

One day, Sarah decided that she wanted to become a professional dancer. She worked hard to improve her skills and began to take dance classes every day. But even as she improved, her self-doubt held her back. She was too scared to audition for any dance companies or competitions.

Sarah's dance teacher noticed her struggles and told her about a famous dancer named Misty Copeland. Misty had also faced many obstacles in her career, including being told that she was too old and not the right body type to be a professional ballet dancer. But she didn't let those setbacks hold her back, and she eventually became the first African-American principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre.

Sarah was inspired by Misty's story and realized that she could overcome her own self-doubt. She decided to audition for a local dance company and was thrilled when she got the part. From that moment on, she began to believe in herself and her abilities.

Sarah continued to push herself and eventually landed a spot in a prestigious dance school. She worked hard, and her dedication and hard work paid off when she got a job as a professional dancer.

Years passed and Sarah became a famous dancer, traveling the world and performing in front of thousands of people. She was proud of herself and happy to have overcome her self-doubt and achieved her dream.

Sarah's story shows that with hard work, determination and not giving up on yourself, anyone can achieve their dreams regardless of the setbacks they face. This story is meant to inspire and motivate, that no matter how hard the path may be, with hard work and perseverance, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your dreams.",readwithme

1674388944.0,Overcoming My Fear of Public Speaking,"I remember the first time I had to give a presentation in front of a large group of people. I was in college and had been assigned to give a speech on a topic of my choosing. As soon as I got up to the podium, my heart started racing, my palms were sweating, and my mind went blank. I stumbled through the presentation, my voice shaking and my hands trembling. I was humiliated and couldn't wait for it to be over.

From that day on, I avoided any situation that required public speaking. I would make excuses not to attend meetings or events where I knew I would have to speak in front of others. I even turned down job opportunities because they required me to give presentations.

But as I entered the workforce, I realized that public speaking is an important skill to have in many careers, including mine. I knew that if I wanted to advance in my career, I would have to overcome my fear of public speaking.

So, I decided to take action. I started small, by giving speeches to small groups of friends and family. As I became more comfortable, I gradually increased the size of the audience. I also read books and articles on public speaking, and found a local Toastmasters group where I could practice my skills in a supportive environment.

But the most important thing I did was to face my fear head-on. I signed up to give a presentation at a local conference. I was petrified, but I knew that this was my chance to prove to myself that I could do it. I prepared for weeks, rehearsing my speech and visualizing myself giving it.

On the day of the conference, I was still nervous, but I felt more prepared than ever before. As I walked up to the podium, I felt my nerves dissipate, and I was able to deliver my speech with confidence. I received positive feedback from the audience, and it was one of the most empowering moments of my life.

Now, I am not saying that I never get nervous when I have to speak in public, but I have learned how to manage my nerves and it has become much easier for me. Public speaking is still not my favorite thing to do, but it is no longer something that I fear. I have realized that facing my fears head-on has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. And I would encourage anyone who is struggling with the same fear to do the same.",readwithme
1674388682.0,My Journey to Becoming a Professional Gamer,"When I was a kid, I never could have imagined that playing video games would one day become my career. But that's exactly what happened. My name is Jack and I'm a professional gamer.

It all started when I was in high school. I had always been a big fan of video games, but I never thought of them as more than just a hobby. But one day, a friend introduced me to the world of esports - competitive gaming. I was immediately hooked. I started playing in local tournaments and quickly realized that I had a real talent for the game.

After graduating high school, I decided to take my passion for gaming to the next level. I enrolled in a college with a strong esports program and started to focus on becoming a professional gamer. I spent countless hours practicing, studying strategies, and honing my skills.

It wasn't easy - balancing college coursework with my gaming commitments was a constant struggle. But I knew that if I wanted to succeed in the competitive world of esports, I had to put in the work.

Eventually, all my hard work paid off. I started getting noticed by professional teams and was eventually signed to one of the top teams in the world. I couldn't believe it - I was living my dream of becoming a professional gamer.

But being a professional gamer is not just about playing the game - it's also about being a role model and representative of the team. I have to maintain a good image and conduct myself professionally, as well as to keep my physical and mental health in check.

Since then, I've competed in major tournaments all over the world, and I've even won a few championships. But what I'm most proud of is the impact I've been able to make on the esports community. I've inspired countless young people to pursue their own dreams of becoming professional gamers, and I'm honored to be a part of something that is changing the way the world sees video games.

I know that my journey as a professional gamer is far from over. There will be challenges and setbacks along the way, but I'm excited for what's to come. I'm grateful for the opportunity to do something I love every day and to be able to make a living doing it.

So if you're reading this and you're thinking about pursuing your own dream of becoming a professional gamer, my advice to you is to never give up. Believe in yourself and put in the work, and you'll be surprised at what you can accomplish.",readwithme

My partner doesn't read, it's not his hobby, but it's definitely one of mine, something I haven't had much time for since having my son, and I'm eager to take this as an opportunity to get back into it.

I'm really looking for ideas of what we could read together, I don't want to pick something as long as The Stand, but I don't want it to be super short either. But also I just don't want him to get bored half way through and give up, because reading isn't his thing. 

Do you think it would be better to read something new to both of us? Or one of my old favourites? And if something new, maybe you could give me some ideas? 

My favourite genres are horror, fantasy and romance, preferably something with all three if I'm honest. My partner strikes me more as a crime thriller vibe, judging by his movie choices over the last few years! I do also really love apocalypse or pandemic stories, The stand is the book I've read most recently that has just really stuck with me, I loved it!

1674235996.0,The Fisherman's luck - An inspirational thought,"**The Fisherman’s luck.**

I genuinely don't know what I'm going to tell you today.

I've tried so many times to think of a great and glamorous incipit, but I still can't think of how to get started. I've been writing it over and over again.

It is known as ""writer's block."" I refer to it as ""fisherman's luck.""

Yes, fisherman’s luck, because ideas are not made, they are found. All you can do is wait like a fisherman patiently waits for a fish to take the bait. Same thing. You sit. You wait. You move around. You wait. You lose your patience. You wait. You lose your hope. You wait. You are just about to give up and then “baam” an idea comes knocking on your door. You smile, you get excited.

But that’s not my story unfortunately.

I know. It sucks; and I promise, I have followed all the guidance, step by step to help an idea come my way. I have waited, my friends… Believe me. I have waited in my room, in the kitchen, by the stairs, on the table, under the table and still… nothing! Not even the most fucking stupid idea has come to me. Nothing!

I feel like I have been left out. I feel like I am the only person in the fucking world who is not capable of coming up with an idea and then doing something good with it. And I hate that feeling! I hate the feeling of not being able to accomplish something while seeing other people succeed. And this is not the first time. 

I hate the feeling of missing out. This is a problem I have been fighting against  since I was a kid. It doesn’t matter what the task is or how many I need to carry out, I still want to make sure that I succeed in all of them, at the same time and with the best outcomes.

I know, you’re going to call me crazy, but this is the devil I have been fighting ever since I can remember: Be the top, be the best, be the bravest, be the number one, be the second to none, be the kindest, be the hero, be the one who saves the world, be yourself, don’t be yourself, be the one in the spotlight, be the one in the corner, be the best friend, be the one who makes more money, be the one that has something to say, be the one that knows when to shut up. Be cool… Be honest. Be arrogant with those who deserve it. Be everywhere. Be nowhere. Just be everything that you can…

BE…

I feel like I have been wearing rugs all my life. I still haven’t found the suit that fits my soul.

 I have no idea who I am, where I am going and what I am looking for.

And with a look on my face like the guy who’s just caught the biggest fish of the day, I stopped and noticed this page is no longer empty. Words have flown in whether I like them or not. 

And such is Life: it goes on regardless of what we think should happen to us.

I salute you my fellow fishermen.",readwithme

1674152176.0,I am able to read books now.,"Ever since young I always hated books, they were boring and picture-less.

I had made an effort to read some but I simply didnt have the attention span and endurance nescessary.

10 years later seems like my problem has been finally fixed in an unexpected way.

For a few years I have been addicted to watching anime, after I ran out of dubbed anime I had to resort to subtitled animes to feed my addiction.

Watching subtitled stuff did hurt my brain at the beggining because I kept having to dart my eyes up and down. but after I got used to it I learned to read using my peripheral vision when the captions were big enough.

Then I decided to watch Saiki Kuso and damn they speak fast, it nearly forced me to double my reading speed to keep up, but its worth it, its the funniest comedy anime ever, go watch it.

The other thing that helped me was getting glasses that actually work, it was hard because no optometrist was able to balance the power of the lenses to reduce strain, but I bought cheap reading glasses from a street vendor and they work much better. 

Now it seems reading is second nature to me and I can do it without paying attention on the text, seems like it frees my mind's eye and now I can simultaneously have a somewhat blurry daydream and read which mean I can daydream what I'm reading as if I was watching it.

Now I finally understand why people read picture-less books, they dont need pictures.",readwithme

1673469967.0,Just joined: Author of Quadrant of Balance,"Hi all,

Just joined and wanted to introduce myself. I'm Daniel (D.K. Hansen). I love to read and always end up in the fantasy genre because of the epic world building, magic, rogues and mythical creatures. But in 2019 I found the passion for writing my own stories when I discovered a few chapters I wrote back in 2014. From there I drafted a plot, characters, and began building the world of Elonia. And then I was hooked. It has grown ever since with my first book, Jarren Heartwood, released in 2021 and my second book, The Omen of Destruction, releasing later this year.

I'm happy to be here in this group with you and excited to hear about your current reads 🙂",readwithme

Hello fellow readers! I’d like to ask for your opinion about a scene in a novel I’m writing. 

How would you react about the following:

He is a lycan prince, and he is your soulmate. He felt your soul awaken the moment you were born but knew he had to wait for you to come of age to get into your life. But he wanted you, he couldn’t stay away from you and needed to know you were safe, so he’s been watching you. 

Eventually he know he has to be honest with you and confess to you he’s been watching you from day one. How would you react?

Have into consideration that at this point, you know who and what he is. You love him and can’t imagine a life without him, after all, he is your soulmate, and you’ve been waiting for the love of your life since the age you started getting interested in dating.",readwithme

1672826971.0,"They say we're past ""social media"" and are now in the age of algorithms: the ""recommendation media.""","With everything that’s happening in the social media space right now — Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter and the subsequent layoff that followed, Meta’s mass layoffs and $36 billion gamble on the metaverse that has yet to yield results, and the earlier collective negative reaction to Instagram’s new algorithm — it’s easy to say that the once darling of the internet has lost its luster, some might even say it’s already dead, or at least on the way there.

But if we look at similar events in the social media timeline — from the rise and fall of Friendster, MySpace, Google+, Tumblr, Vine and many others that walked the same path — the space and all those in it are probably just changing. But what is it changing into? For some pundits, it’s transforming into what he calls the “[recommendation media.](https://medium.com/blockchain-biz/recommendation-media-is-here-but-is-it-what-we-need-a5564609e03c)”

Here, the main mode of content distribution is no longer users’ network or social graph. Instead, content is shared through centralised algorithms. These are designed to attract the most attention, bring forth the most emotion, and to produce the most engagement. It’s a battle of what’s the best thing to watch, read, or listen to.

1637552784.0,How do I like reading?,"&#x200B;

1. Throughout my entire life, reading has been one of my least favorite things to do in my free time. Usually, the only time I read books and stuff like that is when its for a project or an essay for school. Basically what I'm saying is that I usually only read when its a school thing. Recently, I bought a book titled ""Alexander Hamilton"" by Ron Chernow. The one thing different about this book is that its one of the few times I voluntarily bought a book on my own, without it being for school. As mentioned in the title of this post, I don't like reading, but this book really interested me for some reason. I really want to like reading, but I guess an 800 page nonfiction book that uses words way out of my vocab probably wasn't the best choice. I got to page 4/818 and was already wanting to put the book down and never open it again. It was a good book, even though I only got through 4 pages, but that didn't mean I wanted to keep reading. Its just so hard to sit down and read something like that without me wanting to get up and do something more enjoyable. I just really want to like reading, but for someone like me, its just so difficult. I've already thought of things like ""Well maybe I just don't like these types of books"" or ""Maybe I need to try something more interesting like Harry potter."" but even then, I still found that reading was a struggle for me. How do I enjoy reading?!",readwithme
